Last year, more than 54,000 new cases of AIDS were reported in this country. This trend is staggering and belies the misperception that somehow the AIDS epidemic in this country or abroad has abated. While it is true that therapeutic and treatment breakthroughs have led to longer and more productive fulfilling lives for those living with HIV, and that the death rate from AIDS has fallen in recent years, the fact remains that this epidemic has no cure and the rate of new infections has not slowed.", "But these are days of great hope, Mr. President, in the fight against AIDS. During the years of inaction by the Reagan and Bush Administrations during the 1980s, we entered the second decade of the epidemic on a much different note: treatments were few, toxic and largely ineffective; training of physicians in the care of patients with HIV was incomplete, uneven and erratic; discrimination and abuse of people living with AIDS in housing, employment and medical care was rampant and abhorrent. It was difficult to have much hope as we entered the 1990s.", "But this decade has seen great promise. We have made significant strides. No longer an immediate death sentence, AIDS has lost some--but certainly not all--of its social stigma. In that dark dawn of the epidemic, Mr. President, who would have believed that we would see a decade in which two Miss Americas would be AIDS activists, touring the country and speaking out on AIDS prevention and care? In the early 1980s, who would have believed that we would have an Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, that funding for the Ryan White program would increase by 260 percent, or that funding for AIDS research would increase by 67 percent?", "And yet, Mr. President, the rumbling of the epidemic has not been stilled. In the early 1980s, who would have believed that some African countries would have 25 or 35 percent infection rates, or that an entire generation of gay men in the United States would be lost? Who would have believed that infection rates would continue at staggering paces at the same time leading voices would declare the epidemic over? Have we truly become victims of our own success?", "I certainly hope not, for as Tony Kushner wrote at the end of his monumental play, Angels in America, ``great work remains to be done.''", "Until we have an AIDS-free day in America, I will not become complacent. As ranking member of the Housing subcommittee, I know that great work remains to be done in finding shelter for people living with AIDS. I was pleased that my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and my friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, were able to answer my request positively to increase funding by $7 million for the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program in the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. This money is crucial as people living with AIDS have a fundamental need for adequate and safe housing. I will continue to work with all of my colleagues to keep the HOPWA program sufficiently funded.", "Great work remains to be done on HIV prevention. We are lacking in our commitment to adequately fund the Centers for Disease Control in their anti-HIV efforts. Until a cure is found, we must ensure that the federal government issues information widely which is accurate, blunt and unequivocal. Prevention efforts work, Mr. President. I have seen the work of the AIDS Action Committee in Boston and I can tell you that their innovative programs are working to slow the spread of AIDS. Unlike the increase in funding which the National Institutes of Health has received, the CDC's prevention efforts have remained at roughly the same level in the past few years. It was my hope that the appropriators would have recognized the unmet needs related to HIV prevention in this country and it is my fear that the failure to keep pace with that need portends a disaster.", "For example, in this legislation as in other legislation this year, we again were subjected to the perennial ill-informed debate on the issue of needle exchange. I am dismayed that the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill will include language which deprives the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using her discretion based on science and empirical academic study to determine if needle exchange programs reduce the transmission of HIV without encouraging illicit drug abuse. This is bad public policy, when Senators act like scientists, and it is bad health policy. It is my hope that the conferees on this bill will restore the Secretary's discretion.", "Great work remains to be done in combating AIDS abroad. We are a failure in our policy toward Africa. Our international efforts need to be bolstered to assist developing countries crippled by the effects of HIV disease. My distinguished colleague and friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has been stalwart in raising the funding levels to fight AIDS abroad in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill and the Congress needs to follow his guidance by continuing to increase these levels. In addition, tomorrow I will introduce the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 to spur research of vaccines to combat diseases which kill more than one million people every year, and I will have much more to say on this topic at that time.", "Great work remains to be done for hemophiliacs. There is perhaps no greater neglect by the federal government in responding to the AIDS epidemic than the ignoring of our hemophiliac population. On November 11, 1998 the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act was signed into law. The bill, authored by the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, received overwhelming bipartisan support, and I was proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bill. When it passed, hemophiliacs felt their thirteen year battle to be compensated for the lapse in regulation of our nation's blood supply was over.", "In the early 1980s, it became apparent that HIV was being improperly screened, and HIV-tainted blood product was being distributed to patients across the country. At the time, there were 10,000 Americans suffering with hemophilia, an illness which requires regular infusions of blood clotting agents.", "According to the Institute of Medicine's report on HIV and the Blood Supply, ``meetings of the FDA's Blood Product Advisory Committee in January, February, July and December 1983 offered major opportunities to discuss, consider, and reconsider . . . and review new evidence and to reconsider earlier decisions, [yet] blood safety policies changed very little during 1983.'' In effect, the report found the FDA was at fault for not responding to clear evidence of transmission dangers. As a result, more than sixty percent of all Americans with hemophilia were infected with HIV through blood products contaminated by the AIDS virus. Currently, more than 5,000 have died and more are dying each day. In my office, I have been visited by courageous hemophiliacs and when they leave, I never know if I will ever see them again. This population has been decimated, Mr. President, and the personal tragedy is unspeakable.", "We must fully fund the Ricky Ray Relief Act. The Senate version of the Labor-HHS-Education bill appropriates $50 million out of the $750 million needed to fund the Ricky Ray Trust Fund, and that is certainly better than the inadequate level of the other body, but it is a far cry from the level needed by the hemophiliac community. Members of this community never anticipated the one-time compensation from the trust fund, intended to assist with staggering medical bills and improve the quality of their lives, would turn out to be a pay-out to their estates.", "You need only to speak to some of my constituents, like Therese MacNeill. She will tell you, as a mom, the hardship she has experienced in coping with the tragedy of losing one son to AIDS and caring for another who is HIV-positive. Terri MacNeill will let you know in no uncertain terms why we must fully fund Ricky Ray to help families who for years were storing HIV-infected blood product in their family refrigerators next to the lettuce and milk, and now are struggling under mountains of medical bills.", "Other countries have recognized the plight of hemophiliacs who were infected by poorly screened blood. Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, and Switzerland are just some of the countries which have established compensation programs. Sixty Senators signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation authorizing the establishment of the Ricky Ray Trust Fund. Now is the time to realize our commitment to the hemophiliac population on par with other countries as well as our own actions in authorizing the bill. I hope that when the appropriations conference committee meets on this bill, the funding levels for the Ricky Ray act are raised substantially.", "Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I am heartened by the response of my friends, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and the able Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, in crafting this legislation. They have risen to an incredible challenge in the funding of programs designed for AIDS care, research and treatment, and I remain committed to work with them during this year and next to finish some of the great work that remains to be done, especially in regard to HIV prevention programs and the Ricky Ray Trust Fund."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/10/07/S12228_increasing-the-federal-response-to-the-aids-epidem/"}
