I read three letters from around the state from seniors who shared their personal stories. On the 12th, I made a commitment to continue to read a different letter every week until the House enacts reform. That was five months ago. Although the House passed a prescription drug bill this summer, I believe it will not help most seniors. So, I will continue to submit letters until Congress enacts a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. This week, I will submit a letter from Virginia Langell of Chippewa Lake, Michigan.", "At most, there are only three weeks left for Congress to enact a meaningful prescription drug benefit. It is critical that we do so before Congress adjourns.", "This week, Newsweek magazine has devoted its cover story to the issue of prescription drugs. It is the same story that I have been sharing on the House floor since April. Seniors are paying too much for their prescription drugs.", "According to Newsweek, the cost of prescription drugs is rising at an alarming rate, at least twice as fast as the rate of inflation. As a result of these increases, pharmaceutical companies are the most profitable in the nation, with an 18.6 percent profit margin in 1999.", "The issue of Newsweek also clarifies that the most visible and loudest opponent of creating a Medical prescription drug benefit, the ``Citizens for Better Medicare,'' a so-called grass-roots organization, is funded primarily by the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, the industry has spent an estimated $65 million on television advertising to persuade senior citizens that a prescription drug benefit is not in their best interest.", "Well, I disagree. I have met with too many seniors, read too many letters, visited with too many families in Michigan who are struggling to buy the prescriptions they need. Too many are forced to make a decision between their prescription medication or buying food or heating their homes. We cannot and should not wait one more day. Congress must enact a voluntary, defined Medicare prescription drug benefit plan.", "Following is a letter from Virginia Langell.", "Dear Congresswoman Debbie Stabenow: here are my receipts for 1998. Also, I would like to have you take a look at these two drugs that jumped up in the past few months: Furosemide: [from] $7.59 [to] $8.79--a jump of $1.20 Adalat: [from] $73.99 [to] $82.99--a jump of $9.00 The prices are ridiculous. It's about time something is done for the seniors. I live on Social Security. I get $735.00 a month. I have 5 prescriptions filled every month, also eye drop prescriptions every two or three months. It costs me $135.00 to $150.00 every month just for drug prescriptions. I would like to see the law makers in Washington live on this kind of income. I have no co-pay for drug prescriptions and also there are the ``over-the- counter[s]'' like aspirin, Ben Gay, etc. I hope you can fight for us and see what can be done. Yours truly, Virginia Langell.", "Assuming that Ms. Langell pays $135/mo for her medication, she pays a total of $1,620.00 per year.", "Under the Democratic plan, she would save: $611.25.", "Under the Republican plan, she would only save: $385.00.", "In other words, Virginia would save more with the Democratic plan: $226.25.", "That is the difference between eating two or three meals a day. That is the cost of heating a small home during the coldest winter months. That is the difference between being able to fill your car with gasoline for trips to and from the doctor's office. It is clear that we must enact a real prescription drug plan now."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/09/20/H7899-5_prescription-drug-coverage/"}
