The gem I'm referring to is Adair County, Kentucky, native and USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator, Hilda Gay Legg.", "I had the privilege of working closely with Hilda prior to her appointment to RUS. She served as executive director and CEO of the Center for Rural Development in Somerset, Kentucky, from 1994 until October 2001. Hilda provided true leadership by turning an upstart conference site into a world class community-oriented interactive center. In that position, she helped develop and implement a broadband telecommunications program in rural communities throughout southern and eastern Kentucky. The Center grew to manage 40 Internet centers that offer high speed, interactive video conferencing and community access to computers. Thanks to the solid foundation built by Hilda, those activities continue today.", "In 2001, President George W. Bush tapped Hilda as the 15th person, and first woman, to serve as the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration--Rural Utilities Service. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed the landmark 2002 Farm Bill which in turn launched a number of new RUS initiatives including a broadband loan and grant program, energy efficiency grants, weather radio grants, and local television guarantees. Hilda took these new responsibilities in stride, leading the agency with professionalism and accomplishing much of our agenda.", "While Administrator, Hilda approved some 5,570 loans and grants totaling nearly $20 billion. These funds will improve water quality in communities throughout America, provide access to top-level treatment in our rural health clinics, and give our schools Internet access to the world. Under her faithful and deliberate watch RUS programs increased by nearly 60 percent while loan delinquency was a mere .1 percent. Hilda's leadership also improved loan processing efficiency, set in motion an intense review of risk management, and accomplished much toward President Bush's goals in the areas of efficient and effective management, broadband deployment, energy independence, and job creation in rural America.", "Hilda has never ceased to serve as an advocate for rural America and she has done so with remarkable class, spunk, and spirit. As her legacy still remains at the Center for Rural Development, I am confident it will also remain at RUS and in communities throughout the nation that have been touched by her efforts.", "Mr. Speaker, although the Federal Government is losing out with Hilda's retirement, I can selfishly say I am thrilled that this precious gem is coming home to Kentucky."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/01/26/E105_tribute-to-hilda-gay-legg/"}
