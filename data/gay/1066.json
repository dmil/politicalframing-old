They are issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th century, when Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas Cole and described with affection by Henry James in his first novel, ``Roderick Hudson.'' They were raised when it hanged two innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and when it tried a police officer, a native son, for the rape of his own child, during the four years that Tracy Kidder spent reporting his new book, ``Home Town'' (Random House), to be published in May. Mr. Kidder, 53, lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, Frances, a painter, but considers Northampton his home, too. As he proudly showed it to a visitor recently, the city give him a parking ticket. No place is prefect. Like ``The Soul of a New Machine,'' his Pulitzer Prize- winning account of the development of a new computer and the advent of the computer age, ``Home Town'' is the portrait of a cultural phenomenon, seen through the lies of the people creating it. It is also the story of a particular town, and how it has made itself a home. The citizens whose experiences are observed in literary detail, from a local judge to a cocaine addict, could be members of a family, sheltered by a civic roof. In this decade, in a successful reverse of the demographic direction of the century, more Americans are now moving from big cities to small towns than from small towns to big cities. A 30-year migration by young professionals, baby boomers and retirees from cities and suburbs to rural, exurban areas has produced a new generation of what are being called ``boomtowns.'' Two hour by car from Boston and three hours from New York, Northampton, an ex-industrial mill town, pretty and preserved, is now the product of settlement like this. Despite an annual decrease in the city's birth rate, the population has remained steady, which city planners attribute to ``income migration.'' said Wayne Feiden, the director of planning and development. ``Who's coming? A lot of well- educated professionals, attracted by a town that's amenity- rich and very comfortable to live it.'' Mr. Kidder, who moved to the area in 1976, is part of the trend. Now, he has filed his report: a firsthand look at life in the type of peaceful place that many find themselves sorely tempted to try. Not everyone stays--native or new arrival. In portraying Northampton, Mr. Kidder has attempted to assemble a set of natural laws, and sides of human nature, that explain what makes any town work, or how it can fail those who love it the most. To those making the move, cities like Northampton are dots on a map chosen on a Sunday visit for their size, their safety, their qualities of life and their nostalgia. They are the garden cities of childhood--the kind of hometown they don't build anymore, the kind they may never have. ``I was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island,'' Mr. Kidder said recently, ``in a place, Oyster Bay, that kind of vanished as I was growing up. Whole towns disappeared, it would seem, under cloverleafs.'' He was walking down the gentle slope of Northampton's Main Street, away from the tiny, turreted city hall, past the Academy of Music, a Moorish 106-year-old municipally operated theater, now showing ``Shakespeare in Love.'' A woman in a floral skirt that brushed the tops of her cowboy boots was offering strollers copies of her book on tape. A squat signboard for the Fire and Water Vegetarian Cafe and Performance Space sat like a toad by the curb. There was a branch office of Dean Witter Reynolds across the street. Northampton is blessed by confluence and circumstance. Bounded by the Mount Tom and Holyoke hills and threaded by the Connecticut and Mill rivers, it is also circled by institution: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, the University of Massachusetts and, sitting at the head of Main Street, the Smith College campus, designed in 1875 by Frederick Law Olmstead. The 19th-century state mental hospital is now abandoned. The poet Sylvia Plath, an undergraduate at Smith in the 1950's, wrote to her mother of walking in the evening to a professor's house for a cocktail party, ``listening to the people screaming.'' Main Street bends slowly through the town, side streets flowing into it, like a third river. ``There are some magical things about this that couldn't have been planned,'' Mr. Kidder said, speaking of the setting's majestic gait. ``This broad sweep that Main Street makes, it makes simply because of the topography, before you had earth-moving equipment.'' Northampton's recent history has a familiar plot--a downtown rescued in the 1970's by creative real estate developers and resident pioneers who discovered and reinvented its historic infrastructure. It is an architectural routine: with restoration and new, entertainment-oriented businesses, the low brick buildings, Victorian clapboard houses, Art Deco theater and a Gothic chess set of city hall and courthouse become an animated Main Street. In Northampton, there are apartments above the shops, stimulating street life at night. The crosswalks at the intersection of Main and King streets, where the town converges, are wired with speakers that signal sonically for the blind and stop traffic in four directions, letting strollers spill momentarily into the square. To the casual eye, it can look more like a marketing concept than a place to live--a factory town retooled by the wish list of the latte generation. A bookshop's magazine display offers an informal census of Northampton's new citizens and visitors: Raygun, Natural History, Birdwatcher's Digest, American Craft, Bike, Fine Homebuilding, Interview, The Writer, Outside, Macworld and Out. The town has been the subject of a ``20/20'' segment because of a large gay and lesbian population. ``It's tempting to parody, but it's too easy,'' Mr. Kidder said, crossing the intersection of Main and King as the crosswalks beep-beeped like Saturday cartoon characters. To the citizenry, it appeared to produce genuine wonderment-- rainbow-haired teen-agers, mothers in Polartec, men in linen sweaters and loafers without socks crowded the open intersection, as cars on four sides sat muzzled like dogs, waiting for the lights. ``What you see is pretty motley, but there is a solid mainstream, an almost invisible background to it,'' he said. Like any town, Northampton is many town, including a town with a native population. As Mr. Kidder writes, the ``Gentrification Is War'' graffito, written prominently on a building downtown, is now softly faded. But two particular towns live together like a couple in a brokered marriage that may or may never grow into love. ``Hamp,'' or native Northampton, shops on the strip of King Street as it leaves town at Main Street, not in ``NoHo,'' or the revitalized downtown, for which Main Street provides the artery. ``In all of downtown, I don't think you can buy a socket wrench,'' Mr. Kidder said. ``When you look at old pictures, there were nothing but hardware stores.'' Because of its newcomers, Northampton is a big, little place, pressured by the demands of the present on the past. ``Without argument, a place begins to go dead,'' Mr. Kidder said, walking on Pleasant Street, where many single-room occupancy houses remain--a short block from Main Street's consumer circus. Local government has kept them there to enforce the town's economic heterogeneity. ``You've got to have this tension. You've got to find a way to let lots of different kinds of people in, and keep them there.'' Mr. Kidder is not ambivalent about Northampton, but he is not foolish, either, ``It's got problems, of course,'' he said, reciting the national roster of gang crime and homelessness and a drug problem in the local schools that is conspicuous for the state. He was at the bar of the Bay State Hotel, a favorite spot opposite the restored train station, now Spaghetti Freddy's, drinking a Diet Coke. Sitting in the dimly lighted, yellow-wood-paneled tavern, with its etched Budweiser mirror, painting of Emmett Kelly and silent blinking jukebox was like being inside a Christmas tree at night. ``And what limits the size of the town is jobs,'' said Mr. Kidder, who is self-employed. ``The largest employer, which was the state mental hospital, closed its doors years ago.'' Wayne Feiden, the planning director, concurred. ``Whenever you see polls in Money magazine and the rest, about the best towns, we never make it,'' he said. ``The jobs aren't there.'' Mr. Feiden added that the danger of being a boomtown was that well-paid professionals like doctors and lawyers, of whom there are many in Northampton, who moved there for its charms, would move on, frustrated from feeling underpaid. ``It's why they don't stay.'' If Northampton does not, despite restored facades, present an unblemished picture, Mr. Kidder makes a strong case that the beauty of a place is not in its skin--it is in its people. They are the simple and dramatic acts and the descriptive faces of his book. They are, he contends, the genius of a place. Mr. Kidder's ``Home Town'' hero is a native, who, as the book concludes, leaves Northampton for the wider world, freed of his ``nick-names,'' as Mr. Kidder characterized the linked chain of time spent growing up in the same small town. ``It seemed to make too much wholesome sense, from a distance,'' Mr. Kidder said, speaking of Northampton. ``And then I ran into this cop,'' he said. ``Tommy O'Connor, at the gym that I go to.'' Mr. Kidder was back at his house, not the home built for a professional couple in Amherst and chronicled in his 1985 book, ``House,'' but a converted creamery on a mill river that runs beneath the dining room windows. He greeted his daughter, Alice, 20, who walked into the kitchen with a bag of groceries from Bread and Circus, a natural-foods supermarket. She pulled mixing bowls from the cupboards to make dessert for dinner--profiteroles, for guests. ``Tommy's a very gregarious guy,'' Mr. Kidder recalled. ``He said, `You don't remember me, do you?' I said no, He said, `Well, I arrested you for speeding five years ago.' '' An electric mixer began clattering in a bowl. ``This guy with a shiny dome had been a curly-haired cop then.'' Mr. Kidder said. ``I remember that after he gave me the ticket, he said, `Have a nice day.' '' Mr. Kidder smiled at the recollection; Mr. O'Connor, who now lives in Washington and works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, remains a friend. ``Anyway, he said, `Why don't you come out and ride with me some night?' He said he'd show me a town I never imagined existed.'' It was, of course, Northampton. Mr. Kidder said, ``And he was right.''"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/04/15/S3770-2_northampton-ma-a-revitalized-city/"}
