This year Capital Pride culminates with the Pride Parade on June 9th and ``The Main Event,'' a street fair on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Capitol, June 10th.", "I have marched in the Pride parades since coming to Congress to emphasize the universality of human rights and the importance of enacting federal legislation to secure those rights for the GLBT community.", "This year's theme, ``Together we can, Together we will,'' holds special meaning for the citizens of the District of Columbia and its GLBT community in particular. Washingtonians live in distinct diverse neighborhoods such as Colonial Village to the North, Fort Drum to the South, Northeast Boundary to the East, and Spring Valley to the West. Together we can unite in our quest for all the rights guaranteed U.S. citizens by the Constitution.", "In 1994 the District of Columbia lost the first vote it ever won on the floor of the House of Representatives, the delegate vote in the Committee of the Whole. The Republicans retracted the District's vote when they assumed control of the House and this right was re-established under Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Our city of 550,000 residents, 10 percent more residents than the entire State of Wyoming, who pay more taxes per capita than 49 of the 50 states, remains the only jurisdiction in the United States subject to Taxation Without Representation. Our Nation's Capital is entitled full voting rights in the House and the Senate. On April 19, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1905, The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. The measure is now before the Senate and is an important milestone on DC's road to full and equal representation.", "This one success is a reminder of the pending legislation that the 110th Congress must pass: The Clarification of Federal Employment Protections Act, The Early Treatment for HIV Act, The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, The Military Readiness Enhancement Act, The Responsible Education About Life Act, The Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act, and The Uniting American Families Act.", "I ask the House to join me in welcoming the celebrants attending the 32nd Annual Capital Pride Festival in Washington, DC, and I take this opportunity to remind the celebrants that U.S. citizens who reside in Washington, DC are taxed without full voting representation in Congress."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/06/11/E1240-4_honoring-the-32nd-annual-capital-pride-festival/"}
