We have lost a colleague of immeasurable creativity and intellect. Our hearts go out to her family and loved ones in this incomprehensible time. In her memory, we stand today to pay homage to her commitment and sacrifice and pledge to further her legacy of equity, diversity and academic excellence.', u'Chancellor Denton dedicated her professional and personal energy to increasing the presence of women and minorities in typically male-dominated academic fields. While pursuing four advanced degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including a Ph.D., she often encountered and fought against prevailing attitudes that were quietly or openly hostile to women in science. Remarkably, her academic career was just beginning to blossom. She held academic appointments at the University of Massachusetts, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she worked from 1987, leaving as professor in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Chemistry. Beginning in 1996, Chancellor Denton was appointed Dean of the College of Engineering and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, the first woman to hold the position at a National Research Council-designated Research One university.', u"On December 14, 2004, Denice Denton was appointed by the University of California Regents as the ninth Chancellor of UCSC. While Chancellor, Denice incorporated the philosophy of achieving excellence through diversity in her agenda. She championed causes on an international level to engage the academic community in a dialogue pursuing equity and advancement in science, math and engineering. Also, as the university's first openly gay Chancellor, Denice embraced her identity and empowered young people and professionals across many disciplines to do the same. Mr. Speaker, it is with great regret that we speak in memory of a life so full of promise and future achievement. But we do so secure in the knowledge of a life already lived so full of accomplishment. Denice Denton was just 46 years old at the time of her death. But in that short time she paved the way for so many to follow."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/28/E1299-3_in-honor-of-denice-dee-denton/'}
