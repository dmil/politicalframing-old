Weiss, who represented New York in the House of Representatives from 1977 until his death in 1992. Earlier this week, a Federal courthouse in New York City was designated the ``Ted Weiss United States Courthouse'' in his memory.", u"With Ted Weiss' death in 1992, New York's 17th Congressional District lost a well-loved and highly popular political leader. This district, one of the most liberal in the country, found a voice in Ted. He consistently championed the interests of the poor and the powerless, and supported civil and human rights both locally and internationally.", u'Born in 1927 in Hungary, Ted escaped Europe one step ahead of the Nazis in 1938, which might explain his life-long opposition to oppressive dictatorships abroad. He criticized the invasion of Granada, lauded the defeat of Pinochet in Chile, and backed sanctions against China, El Salvador, and other countries that perpetrate human rights abuses. When he served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he made humanitarian aid a special concern, proposing additional food assistance to drought-stricken Africa. A long-time advocate for peace, Ted consistently voted against funding for military projects and supported a nuclear weapons freeze.', u'Ted was also an active advocate for the rights of his own constituency. He was a leader for gay and lesbian rights; he sought aid for the mentally ill and homeless; and he fought for reparations for Holocaust victims and Vietnam veterans who were exposed to agent orange. For much of his career, Ted served on the House Education and Labor Committee, where he fought cutbacks in social programs.', u'Ted was well-known for his concern for the health and safety of his constituents. He pressed the Food and Drug Administration to rigorously guard against dangerous drugs and food additives on the market. He also advocated increased funding for AIDS research and urged the NIH to conduct further experiments in drug treatment.', u"Ted Weiss demonstrated true dedication and commitment to human and civil rights. It is only fitting that the ``Ted Weiss United States Courthouse'' be named in his honor, a testament to his efforts on behalf of equity and justice. I respectfully urge my colleagues to take a moment today to remember Ted Weiss, a man who made innumerable contributions to his own district, as well as to the world at large."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/10/02/E1932-3_tribute-to-theodore-s-weiss/'}
