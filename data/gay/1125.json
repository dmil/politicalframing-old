As you know, most of the talk is centered around the issue of education. While I was sitting here listening, I thought really that most Members of Congress that are up for election were back home campaigning. But I guess they are not, because some have been here this afternoon campaigning on the floor of the Senate. I heard today some of the outlines of what was basically their very liberal agenda, which did not pass some very radical proposals that this Congress did not accept.', u"They talked about delays and about the lack of work in this session, but they didn't mention that this Congress has required more cloture motions just to try to get issues onto the floor. We have also heard, I think, some real tall tales of revision of the history of budget negotiations, et cetera, talking about how much credit should go to this President for the current economic benefits that we are reaping. But somehow they forget a lot of the work done during the 1980s, like the tax cut, deregulation of many industries, the productivity of workers and companies that have basically produced more revenue for this Government to allow us to balance the budget. It really hasn't been anything that this President has done to balance the budget.", u'If you talked about this big budget plan offered in 1993--which I am proud to say not one Republican supported because the centerpiece of that plan was just like every other Democratic proposal over the last 40 years--that was to raise taxes on the American people in order to try to solve what they saw as a crisis or problem, but the real intent was to enlarge and expand the size and scope of Government, to bring more control to Washington. This plan raised $263 billion in new taxes--the largest tax increase in history in this country--which has now taken the average American family to the highest levels of taxation in history, with over 42 percent for the average American going to taxes. That means you work just about as much time to support Government as you are allowed to work to raise your family, to support your family--health care, educational needs, food, clothing, shelter, et cetera.', u"I have to say that if it was such a great idea to raise taxes and that solves the problems, I don't know why we don't simply say let's raise taxes to 100 percent of what you make so the Government can be real sure that it takes care of every need that you have, and we can be on the floor here bragging next year, or the year after and the year after how great Washington has done.", u"When you see some of the waste, fraud and abuse in this Government, the bureaucracy--and we can sit here and say that Washington can handle problems better than the American family. Mr. President, that kind of baffles the mind. Some people think raising taxes and sending more money to Washington is a godsend, and it has somehow taken care of all the problems in this country, when I don't think too many people out there would want Washington to be their own financial adviser when they can't even count on Social Security to be there. I wanted to express more concern and basically disappointment over what appears to be an eleventh-hour attempt now by the President to force straitjacket education policy on our Nation's schools and children.", u"The President brought this up a year ago in his State of the Union Address. There has been no legislation or ideas brought to the floor on increasing the size or putting more teachers into the classroom. Everybody can agree that education is probably one of the most important things that we need in this country. Again, I don't know if people want to give that control over to Washington and have them hiring teachers, telling us who we can hire and fire in the classroom. They would go from there to what the curriculum is going to be. Then they would tell us what to teach the children and what books to read.", u"When you talk about revision of history and what we have heard here on the budget issues alone, can you imagine what our textbooks are going to be like when we hear some apologizing for Christopher Columbus? Can you imagine the difference in the wealth and lifestyle of this great country? In some of our textbooks, Christopher Columbus is being viewed as somebody who did things wrong. Sure, there were problems back then, and there were new diseases brought to this continent. But to say now that we should be apologizing for what Christopher Columbus did, or maybe apologize for how this country ended World War II--nobody wanted to use the bomb, but to rewrite the stories of the Enola Gay and say America was somehow responsible for World War II, we didn't start the war. We had to find a way to end it. It was not a pleasant way to do it, but it did save lives from the day-to-day fighting. There would not have only been thousands more American soldiers who would have died, in addition to the thousands who died in World War II, but thousands more Japanese civilians would have been killed as well.", u'Mr. President, President Clinton and others in Congress have decided to renew their one-size-fits-all argument that they know how best to spend education dollars for each and every student, in each and every school in the country, from the inner city to rural classrooms.', u"Education for all is a top priority, as I mentioned. All of us have the top priority of education for our children and grandchildren. That politicians are using it today as a last-ditch political coverup, I believe, is beneath contempt. The central charge being made is that the Republican-led Congress hasn't met the demands for increases in education spending. This simply is not the case.", u"According to the Senate Budget Committee, in the last three budget cycles during which Republicans have controlled Congress, this Congress has provided $79 billion, or 97 percent of the President's education requests.", u"In other words, in 5 of the last 6 years, there has been less than a 3-percent difference between the President's request for education outlays and what Congress has provided. And to suggest otherwise is nothing but pure politics.", u"As we have seen time and time again in Washington, it is very easy to just go out there and try to up the ante. When I say that, what they are trying to do out here is bribe the American people with your money. In other words, they just want to take a little bit more of our money to Washington, raise your taxes, erode your tax bases, take more money away from your tax base to support your own local schools so they can up the ante out here in Washington, because Washington can't give you anything. It can't enrich your school districts until it takes something from you. So it has to take money from you to bring it to Washington and promise you something that they are going to give back, but with a lot of strings--and by the way, a lot less money, because by the time you support the buildings and bureaucracy here in Washington, you are only getting pennies on the dollar back.", u"Somehow, they promise you something, but they don't tell you who is going to pay for it. Sure, some might be getting more money back than they paid, but most Americans are going to pay more in taxes to get this type of help from Washington. When you give that control to Washington, you as parents lose control at home over what decisions are going to be made, whether it is over teachers, curriculum, et cetera.", u"So upping the ante here, its easy for somebody to try to outbid the other, saying let's do $3 billion or $5 billion or $7 billion--it is all your money. So it is easy to up the ante so as to be able to complain that Congress isn't spending enough. We have seen this painfully played out, for example, in making emergency moneys available for our Nation's farmers.", u"One tell-tale sign that the administration's proposals are for ``show'' only is that they cannot be met without breaking the budget. I heard here a while ago that the spending bidding wars the President is talking about right now is not going to break the budget, that it is all offset. I don't know where it is coming from. I haven't seen the offsets. The only offset I have seen is that it is going to come out of the budget surplus.", u"Something in the neighborhood of $20 billion of surplus money is already being spent by this administration. He is trying to twist the arms of the Republican Congress to go along with this looming threat of a possible Government shutdown, or saying we don't care about education, or we don't care about the American farmer. But somehow Republicans wanted to give a tax break because some of the surplus money is from larger revenues due to income growth. We say, if we are overbilling the American people, maybe we should give some money back. They say, you can't do that, and they say they think about Social Security first. That tax cut would have been about $7 billion in the year 1999. That was too much money to give $7 billion back, which would amount to basically less than $1 a month per person in this country.", u"That is a huge tax cut--less than $1 a month--$7 billion? They couldn't do that. But yet $20 billion of that surplus can be spent. And they are saying, ``Well, we are not taking this out of the surplus; we are going to offset it.'' I would like to know where they are offsetting it, and, if they are offsetting it in some programs, I would like to know where those programs are going to be able to get along with less money, after all of this year trying to work out budgets through our committees. The President knows this.", u'The only offset proposal has been through increased tobacco taxes. That is what we heard earlier this year. That is how the President was going to pay for 100,000 new teachers. That is how the President was going to pay for rebuilding new schools. And that, by the way, is the prerogative, the responsibility, the opportunity, of the local school boards and school districts. They should be doing this--not the Federal Government, because the Federal Government then has to make money from them to give back to them. But, in the meantime, they lose a lot of control and authority. But when there was no tobacco bill this year--again, this is one of the radical liberal agendas that did not pass this Congress that we have heard complaints about. Again, I am very proud to have voted against that piece of legislation. But there is no money there.', u"So, if there is no money from the tobacco legislation, now the President is saying we are going to have to dip into something else. But it is going to come out of the surplus, and that is the extra money that you have worked for, which Washington now has and won't give back. Congress has rejected that plan. The President has now proposed an alternative method of financing his proposal. Another giveaway as to the political nature of this last-minute demagoguing is the plain fact that simply spending more money in Washington for the sake of spending more money does nothing to solve the education problems in this country. I think the President should pay attention to the fact that it is going to take a little more time and a little more effort to solve these problems than he has been willing to devote in the past.", u"If this is such an important issue, which I think it is, I think we need to have Congress to bring it before our committee. Let's sit down and debate it and lay it all out and see where the advantages are, how much it is going to cost and where the money is going to come from, rather than the President trying to again break arms and jam it into an omnibus budget bill. In fact, spending money blindly may ultimately do more harm than good.", u'According to a recent article in the Washington Post,', u"The nation's largest study examining the use of computers in schools has concluded that the $5 billion being spent each year on educational technology is actually hurting children in many cases because the computers aren't being put to good use.", u'While I support teaching out kids to use technology, and computers are an important part of this, I do not believe high-tech classrooms are the only priority.', u"And, while spending great sums of money on technology-education is feel-good politics for those who spend the money, it can come, as we've seen, at the expense of our kids.", u'Last year, the American Management Association found that two-thirds of managers said new employees had strong computer skills, but that only 29 percent said the employees could write competently.', u"I am always reminded of a story, because I think it suggests some very serious education problems in this country: A small school district in northern Minnesota was being given an award because their students had ranked among the top in the scores that year. In the test scores out there, their students had ranked among the top. Somebody came up, and while they were going through some of the records, they noticed that this school district had some of the lowest costs per pupil in the State. So the question was asked: ``How can you account for having higher test scores when you have had some of the lowest spending per pupil year?'' The principal said, ``I don't know how to explain it.'' He said, ``All we can basically do is offer our kids the basics.''", u"In other words, they were teaching them to read, to write, and to do arithmetic rather than the ``feel good'' diversity type programs that we see teachers now hamstrung with today. They can spend less than half of their costs on the basics, because the Government dictates today already preclude them from teaching their kids the basics.", u'When they talk about money in this country, that we are not spending enough money--we spend more on education; it is only second to health care. About $450 billion a year goes to education. That is more than any country in the world spends per student per year. In fact, if you look at the numbers, the United States spends nearly twice as much per student per year as any country in the world. Yet we rank 14 out of 14 of the industrialized nations in the world in test scores when it comes to math and sciences and the ability to write.', u"So, if other countries can spend less and get more, where is the problem? The problem isn't the amount of money that we are spending on education, it is how that money is being used. And now, to say if we could only come back and throw some more money at it--I will give you an example. Back in the 1950s, if we adjusted to inflation today, the States were spending an average of about $600 per student per year in education. Today, 1998, we are spending well over $6,000 per student per year--from $600 in 1950 to over $6,000 today.", u'The District of Columbia spends over $10,000. In Minnesota, the city of Minneapolis spends over $10,000 per student and yet has some of the lowest test scores in the State.', u'So, again, is it the money? Or is it some of the ways that we are teaching our children, or some of the programs, or the time that our kids are being given to study the basics in order to learn?', u'I think the ones who really come out on the short end of this are the students. While we are up here debating all of this, saying that we need all this curriculum, that we need all this money, that we need all this stuff, our kids are graduating with some of the lowest test scores around the world, without the ability to compete in the next generation. They are the ones being shortchanged while a lot of this debate is going on here. I think those problems show that our students are not learning the basics despite our spending efforts.', u"Over the last 30 years, as I have mentioned, we have increasingly spent more of the Nation's money on education. Nominal spending has risen eightfold since 1969.", u'Furthermore, a recent Wall Street Journal article reports that in the past 45 years the average pupil-teacher ratio in this country has already fallen by 35 percent. In the past 45 years, the student-teacher ratio has fallen 35 percent. Yet, our test scores have fallen with it. The SAT scores have stagnated, and the international tests have put them at the bottom.', u'In Math and Science General Knowledge tests, United States students ranked 16th out of 21 in science, behind Russia and Slovenia but ahead of Cyprus.', u'In math, United States students ranked 19th out of 21 countries, behind Russia, Slovenia, Hungary, and Lithuania. America already outspends every other country per child on education, and ranked among the bottom of all.', u"Clearly, simply spending more money is not the answer to better learning. If it were, we certainly wouldn't have these sorts of test scores to show for it.", u"The answers to our education problems do not lie in ``wired classrooms.'' No computer can take the place of a good teacher. Instead, I believe that the answers to learning are found in each and every teacher-child relationship, in each and every classroom.", u'There is no amount of money that can replace a teacher who cares and wants to reach kids, and has the freedom to do so.', u'This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based on local needs--not dictates from Washington, not more control from Washington, not more strings attached to the classrooms from Washington. I have continually supported plans which would return money and also return control from Washington to parents, to teachers, and to local school districts. After all, I think they know best how to spend their education dollars.', u'Plans such as the Education Savings and School Excellence Act would have been an important step toward accomplishing this.', u'This bipartisan education reform legislation would have allowed low- and middle-income families to open education savings accounts to pay for the particular education needs of their children--from textbooks to tutoring to tuition.', u"Unfortunately, for families and students, President Clinton vetoed this legislation. There has been an agenda dealing with education in this Congress this year. It has gone nowhere, because the President and those Members on that side of the aisle --the Democrats--have disagreed and have stalled the efforts, or have vetoed it with the President's plan, claiming that it would divert resources from public education. This is false. The Education Savings and School Excellence Act would not have touched 1 cent of Federal spending for education--would not have touched 1 cent of the surplus either. It would have come from parents being able to set aside more of their own money so that they could decide how they wanted to spend it for their children's education--whether they needed additional tutoring, or tuition to go to a private or parochial school, or whatever the parent decided they needed. But they vetoed that plan.", u'The reason the President vetoed this legislation--and I will be generous with this inference--is because he thinks he knows what is best for each and every student if America.', u"But I would ask my colleagues to reflect on this for just a moment and to see if they aren't forced to come to the same conclusion: To think that the U.S. Government should impose a rigid generic formula on day-to-day decisions for all students is nothing short of frightening.", u"So, Mr. President, I thank you very much for the time, and I hope we can work out these questions in the remaining days. Some of the questions now do not relate to the amount of money being spent on education but is being narrowed down to who is spending it, who controls it. I think the Republicans have made it very clear that if the money is to be spent, it should go to local school districts so that the parents and the teachers and local officials can decide how that money should be spent, not Washington. But on the other side, they would rather have the money come here to Washington so they can disperse it, so they can tell parents, teachers, local school districts and local officials how those dollars should be spent. I think Americans would rather have those local options left to themselves because this is incrementalism at its best. If you let Washington get its foot in the door, the camel's nose under the tent, it is only going to be a matter of time before they want more and more control over education in this country.", u'I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/12/S12379-4_debate-during-the-final-days-of-the-105th-congress/'}
