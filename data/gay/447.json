This year Capital Pride Festival culminates with what Washington's City Paper has declared D.C.'s Best Parade for two years running, the Pride Parade on June 13th and ``The Main Event,'' a street fair on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Capitol, June 14th.", "This year, the Festival's new organizers, the Capital Pride Alliance, Inc., anticipates an attendance of 250,000, making Capital Pride one of the largest GLBT festivals in the United States.", "2009 marks the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which, in the early hours of June 28, 1969, New York City's GLBT community spontaneously and publicly asserted its rights in defiance of government oppression. The Capital Pride commemorates this event with the theme ``Generations of Pride: Celebrate and Remember.''", "I have marched in the Pride parades since coming to Congress to emphasize the universality of human rights and the importance of enacting federal legislation to secure those rights for the GLBT community and the District of Columbia. Congress has much work to do. We must pass The Family Leave Insurance Act of 2009, Employment Non-Discrimination Act, The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act/Matthew Shepard Act, Safe Schools Improvement Act, The Military Readiness Enhancement Act, The Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act, The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act, Uniting American Families Act, Responsible Education About Life Act, and the Early Treatment for HIV Act.", "This year, as Iowa, Maine, and New Hampshire have extended full rights to their GLBT residents. Our city of 600,000 residents, 10 percent more residents than the entire State of Wyoming, who pay more taxes per capita than 49 of the 50 states, remains the only jurisdiction in the United States where all its citizens are denied their basic rights by being subjected to Taxation Without Representation.", "The residents of our Nation's Capital are entitled all their rights as citizens. I support and, I will defend, D.C. Council's action to extend full faith and credit to all marriages contracted in the United States as necessary to stabilize and protect all D.C. Families.", "I ask the House to join me in welcoming the celebrants attending the 34th Annual Capital Pride Festival in Washington, DC, and I take this opportunity to remind the celebrants that U.S. citizens who reside in Washington, DC are taxed without full voting representation in Congress."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/05/12/E1121-7_honoring-the-34th-annual-capital-pride-festival/"}
