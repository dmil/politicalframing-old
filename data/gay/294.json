At the close of this week, Citadel Communications Group will officially take over Dick Broadcasting Company, located in Knoxville.', u'Nearly 50 years ago, in December 1952, the FCC granted Mr. James A. Dick a license to build a 1,000-watt, daytime only, AM radio station, and Dick Broadcasting was born. On March 20, 1953, WIVK AM-860 signed on the air.', u"From it's first studios on North Gay Street, WIVK's early days were filled with programs such as ``The Big Jim and Little Alf Show,'' ``Mull's Singing Congregation,'' ``The Gospel Train,'' ``Archie Campbell's Hillbilly Show,'' and the legendary ``Cas Walker Live Country Music Show.'' Such future stars as the Everly Brothers and Dolly Parton found a home performing on WIVK's airwaves.", u"Later in the history of this radio station, we saw the beginning of the ``Great Day Show'' with Claude ``The Cat'' Tomlinson, Lester Longmire, and ``Old Man Schultz.'' This show would go on to dominate local ratings and remain virtually unchanged until Claude's retirement in 1992.", u"The Dick Broadcasting Family has grown from a 1,000 watt AM station to 14 FM and AM stations operating in three states. Now a FM station, WIVK's unique mix of country music, community involvement, personality, and of course, University of Tennessee sports, has made it one of the most-listened to radio stations in America from the late 70's to present day.", u'For over 45 years now, Dick Broadcasting has sought to provide East Tennessee with the best in music and entertainment, and the most up-to-date news and information. When a severe blizzard hit East Tennessee in 1993, WIVK was the only radio station left on the air.', u"In 1988, Dick Broadcasting purchased WNOX-AM 990, and donated the old WIVK-AM 860 to the University of Tennessee. The new 990 frequency had the advantage of being a 24-hour. channel. WIVK-AM 990 soon started adding its own programming, and by 1992 had become its own entity as ``NewsTalk 990.''", u'Mr. Speaker, I know that I join with the citizens of the City of Knoxville in congratulating Jim Dick for his service and devotion to the people of East Tennessee. I am proud to call him a friend, and I wish him well in the years to come. I ask my fellow colleagues and other readers of the Record to join me in thanking Jim Dick and Dick Broadcasting Company for their many years of service and contributions to East Tennessee. Our Nation is certainly a better place because of people like Jim Dick and his family.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/09/27/E1609-3_congratulating-james-a-dick-and-the-dick-broadcast/'}
