And as our hearts go out to the families of these three individuals, we should also remind ourselves and call upon the State Department to continue to support resolutions and actions in support of indigenous groups, particularly in our own State Department's work in the United Nations as declarations are pursued there and in the organization of American States.", "Again, I rise in very strong support of this resolution.", "Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/10/04/H9259-2_condemning-kidnapping-and-murder-by-the-revolution/"}
