This bill is also being introduced in the Senate by my good friend, Jay Rockefeller.", "Mr. Speaker, this year we are honoring the 40th anniversary of Medicare, our nation's health insurance program for the elderly and people with disabilities. At the time we created Medicare, our nation's seniors were more likely to be living in poverty than any other age group. Most were unable to afford needed medical services and unable to find health insurance in the market even if they could afford it. Today, as a result of Medicare's success, seniors are much less likely to be shackled by the bonds of poverty.", "Now it is our nation's children who are most likely to be poor. Kids in America are nearly twice as vulnerable to poverty as adults. This travesty is not only morally reprehensible, it also denotes grave consequences for the future of our country. Poor children are often malnourished and have difficulty succeeding in school. Untreated illnesses only worsen the chance for success. The future of our country rests in our ability to provide our children with the basic conditions to thrive and become healthy, educated, and productive adults. Guaranteeing continuous health coverage is a critical component of realizing this potential.", "The MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2005 assures that every child in the United States has health insurance by 2012. Modeled after Medicare--with benefits appropriate to children, simplified cost sharing, and comprehensive prescription drug coverage--MediKids covers America's kids from birth until age 23.", "MediKids assures that families will always have access to affordable health insurance for their children. Parents retain the choice to enroll their kids in private plans or government programs such as Medicaid or S-CHIP. However, if a lapse in other insurance coverage occurs, MediKids automatically fills in the gap. MediKids is the ultimate safety net, available nationwide, with maximum simplicity, stability, and flexibility.", "Many children's advocates and health care professionals who care for children are united in their support for MediKids, including: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Nurses Association, Consumers' Union, FamiliesUSA, the March of Dimes, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Association of Community Health Centers, National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, and the National Health Law Program. I am submitting a sampling of letters from these groups along with my statement.", "I can think of no better use of Congress' time than to provide health insurance to every child. While some are fixated on flag burning, Terri Schiavo and banning gay marriages, my colleagues and I are offering solutions to real problems facing American families. Providing a simple, stable, and flexible health insurance option will afford millions of parents the peace of mind of knowing that their children will be cared for when they are sick. Our nation's priorities should be centered on creating a bright future for our children, and MediKids helps to achieve this goal.", "I look forward to working with my colleagues and the many endorsing organizations to enact the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2005.", "The MediKids Health Insurance Act provides health insurance for all children in the United States regardless of family income level by 2012. The program is modeled after Medicare, but the benefits are improved and targeted toward children. MediKids is the ultimate safety net, with maximum simplicity, stability, and flexibility for families. Parents may choose to enroll their children in private plans or government programs such as Medicaid or S-CHIP. However, if a lapse in other insurance coverage occurs, MediKids automatically picks up the children's health insurance. MediKids follows children across state lines when families move, and fills the gaps when families climbing out of poverty become ineligible for means-tested programs."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/06/24/E1339-2_introduction-of-the-medikids-health-insurance-act-/"}
