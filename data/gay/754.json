None of us could discharge our responsibilities without the help and support of the staff.', u'Let me begin by expressing gratitude to the employees of the Architect of the Capitol, who maintain the Capitol buildings and grounds. Without the vital work of engineers, carpenters, painters, electricians and others, especially the custodians who clean our offices each night, we could not work. AoC employees do a wonderful job under difficult circumstances, and they deserve special recognition.', u'Next, I wish to thank the three House Officers and all their employees, who collectively maintain the framework in which the House operates. Jay Eagen, our Chief Administrative Officer, and his deputy Lawrence Davenport, manage a diverse organization that provides us with everything from furniture and carpets to office supplies and information technology, child care and other personnel-related support, including food services and even our paychecks. Bill Livingood, our Sergeant at Arms, and his deputy, Kerri Hanley, oversee Capitol security for the benefit of Members, staff, dignitaries, tourists and others who visit the complex every year, working in conjunction with the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police. Our Clerk, Jeff Trandahl, his deputy, Martha Morrison, and their staff compile the House Journal, tally our votes, enroll our bills, transcribe our debates, and generally ensure that our legislative process functions smoothly. Jeff also oversees the Page program, which provides an enriching experience for the Pages, who do a great job.', u'Let us all give thanks for the House Chaplain, Father Daniel Coughlin, who tends his flock superbly. Charles Johnson, our distinguished Parliamentarian, and his learned duputies and assistants John Sullivan, Tom Duncan, Muftiah McCartin, Tom Wickham, Ethan Lauer, Gay Topper, Brian Cooper and Debby Khalili, provide invaluable procedural guidance to the Speaker and Members who preside over the House. I recall being greatly comforted by their presence when, during an earlier era, I occasionally occupied the Chair.', u'The General Counsel, Geraldine Gennet, and her staff well represent the House in legal matters. The Law Revision counsel, John Miller, and his staff organize our legislation into a useful body of laws. The Inspector General, Steve McNamara, and his staff help us seek ways to improve the administration of the House. For all of them we are grateful.', u"We are also greatly indebted to the Legislative Counsel, Pope Barrow, and his staff for helping us draft legislation. They work long hours, often under intense pressure, transforming our public-policy ideas into the magic words of bills and amendments, doing so with grace and magnanimity and making it look easy. I want to applaud one particular legislative counsel, Noah Wofsy, whose help has been indispensable to the Committee on House Administration, most recently on the landmark Help America Vote Act (H.R. 3295). I greatly value Noah's help and expertise, and look forward to working with him again during the second session.", u"We also owe special thanks to our cloakroom staffs, who always have the answer to our favorite question (``when's the next vote?''), and to our leadership and floor staff, who are crucial members of the team.", u"We should also remember our ``extended'' staff, including Dan Mulhollan and his experts at the Congressional Research Service, and Dan Crippen and his Congressional Budget Office staff, all of whom provide excellent support to our deliberations. The Attending Physician, Dr. John Eisold and his staff, have coped superbly with the anthrax attack and its aftermath, inspiring confidence. As always, the professionals of the Government Printing Office and the General Accounting Office have provided exceptional support. Our tour guides provide constituents wonderful tours of the Capitol, for which we, and they, are always thankful.", u'Finally, I wish to thank the committee and joint-committee staffs, and the personal staffs of Members, whose efforts are also highly valued. I am obviously most grateful for the work of my own staff, beginning with Cory Alexander, John Bohanan, Betsy Bossart, Tom Craddock, Chonya Davis-Johnson, Stacey Farnen, Wanda Hardesty, Corey Jackson, Dayle Lewis, Kenya McGruder, Kathy May, Scott Nance, Faron Paramore, Andy Quinn, Thomas Richards, Betty Richardson, Betty Rogers, Erica Rossi, and Ryan Seggel of my personal office; Keith Abouchar, Robert Bean, Kevin Cyron, Connie Goode, Michael Harrison, Charles Howell, Ellen McCarthy, Matt Pinkus, Bernard Raimo, David Ransom, Brian Romick, and Sterling Springs of the House Administration Committee; Rob Nabors, of the Treasury, Postal Appropriations Subcommittee; and Marlene Kaufman, of the Helsinki Commission. I could not fulfill my responsibilities without them.', u"Mr. Speaker, Members aren't always aware of what all the staff do, and the staff aren't always aware of what Members do. But together, we make this House work for the American people. I hope all Members will join me in thanking the staff, wherever they work and whatever they do, for all their hard work this year."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/12/20/H10959_thanking-the-staff/'}
