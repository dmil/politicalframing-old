For two decades, these scholarships have provided promise and support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered (LGBT) and Allied students with strong commitment to civil rights.", "In 1990, two teachers witnessed the challenges that confronted LGBT students as they pursued a college education, including discrimination from professors, harassment by other students, and unsupportive families. These teachers took matters into their own hands and created the GSBA Scholarship Fund, the first scholarship fund for LGBT students in the United States. That year, the GSBA gave two scholarships of $1,500 each. Since then, the Fund has grown significantly, and now grants a total of $135,000 in scholarships each year, with the individual scholarships ranging in size from $3,000 to $10,000.", "One thing that makes the Scholarship Fund so special is the diversity of the students it supports. GSBA scholars come from every corner of Washington State, from cities and from rural communities. They are people of color, male, female, and transgender. But no matter where they come from, these talented students have the drive and the passion to achieve great things in their lives. Indeed, former GSBA scholars have gone on to become doctors, social workers, teachers and public servants. And these scholars have continued to fight for social justice and equality for all, regardless of the careers they chose.", "This 20th anniversary marks a particularly special milestone for the GSBA Scholarship Fund--the awarding of its one millionth dollar to support the education of LGBT and Allied students. The unfailing dedication of time, money, and talent by GSBA leadership, members, and volunteers have made this achievement possible. I extend my thanks and best wishes to the GSBA and its outstanding scholars on their twenty years of changing lives and creating hope."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/05/18/E862_recognizing-the-greater-seattle-business-associati/"}
