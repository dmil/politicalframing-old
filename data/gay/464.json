Assemblymember John Laird, who has represented the coastal portions of Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties in the California legislature for the last 6 years, will leave the legislature at the end of this current term as a result of term limits. I know I speak for the whole House, particularly my colleagues from the California delegation, in extending our gratitude and admiration to John for his Assembly service.', u"In 2002, John was first elected to represent the 27th Assembly District, which I represented during my tenure in the Assembly. His constituents, including me, returned him to the Assembly in 2004 and 2006 by overwhelming margins. Once in office, John quickly gained a reputation as a quick study of complex policy matters and a member who works with just about anybody in the Capitol. At the start of his second term in 2004, Mr. Laird joined the Assembly leadership team as chair of the Budget Committee, a position to which he won reappointment to in December 2006. As budget Chair, John was a key figure in working with the Governor and other legislative leaders in crafting the State's annual budget. Sometimes those other parties went along with John and the budget came in on time. Other times, those other parties departed from John's lead and delayed the budget's adoption. In each of these budgets, John left his stamp on the lives of Californians by fighting for reduced community college fees, K-12 education, and funding for transportation, park maintenance and foster care.", u"During Mr. Laird's tenure, he authored a wide range of bills that were signed into law--to establish the landmark Sierra Nevada Conservancy, restore community college health services, and to expand and clarify State civil rights protections. In the 2006 session, he successfully authored bills to provide new protections for sea otters, help build a new veterans cemetery at the former Fort Ord, provide pay increases for park rangers and fish and game wardens, and support local affordable housing trusts.", u"Raised in Vallejo and educated in Vallejo public schools, Mr. Laird's parents both were educators. They bequeathed to John a deep respect for public service and a passion for the Chicago Cubs. He graduated from UCSC's Adlai Stevenson College. He served on the congressional district staff of Congressman Jerome Waldie, was an analyst for the Santa Cruz County Administrative Officer, and was Executive Director of the Santa Cruz AIDS Project.", u"In 1981, Mr. Laird was elected to a seat on the Santa Cruz City Council where he served until 1990. He was elected by the City Council to one-year mayor's terms in 1983 and 1987, becoming one of the first openly gay mayors in the United States. He served as an elected member of the Cabrillo College Board of Trustees from 1994 to his election to the Assembly in 2002. Thanks to the recent landmark decision by the California Supreme Court, John was able to marry his longtime partner John Flores.", u"Madam Speaker, I can think of no better argument against California's legislative term limits than John's leadership and record. On behalf of the House, I want to wish John and his husband every happiness and urge him to continue his great record of service."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/09/27/E2072-2_in-honor-of-john-laird/'}
