So, I regret that instead we are considering a similar but not identical measure. Unlike the bill I have cosponsored, H.R. 3685 does not fully protect the full lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. And because of that, some supporters of the bill I have cosponsored have suggested that it would be better for Congress to pass no legislation rather than to enact this bill in its current form.", "I understand their frustration, because I recognize that transgender people face particularly pervasive and severe bias in the workplace and society as a whole and have little protection against employment discrimination under existing State laws, municipal ordinances, or private employment policies.", "But although I share their disappointment about the bill's shortcomings, I will support it because I am convinced that H.R. 3685 will improve protections for many thousands of people who might otherwise continue to face unjust discrimination.", "Madam Chairman, history shows that legal progress against injustice does not come easily or swiftly.", "For example, when Congress and the ratifying States approved the Constitution's 15th Amendment to try to assure the right to vote would not be denied on the basis of race, women were not included--and, although in 1893 Colorado's male voters amended our constitution to include women, other States excluded them until a further amendment took effect. Similarly, since then until the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and subsequent amendments, it has required repeated legislative enactments to construct the structure of legal protections in place today.", "Erecting that structure of protection took longer than it should have, but it would have taken longer still if Members of Congress had refused to vote for good measures because they were not good enough.", "And while I would have wished it otherwise, I think that is the choice before the House today.", "We can vote to further the spirit and intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act--which protects against discrimination against employees or job applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin--by expanding it to similarly bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. Or we can refuse to take that step because it is not the entire journey we want to complete.", "I want to take that step, although I know it is not the only one needed. So I will vote for this bill."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/11/08/E2361-4_providing-for-consideration-of-hr-3685-employment-/"}
