Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.', u"Early in the morning of September 3, 2007, Andrew Geske and a friend were walking home in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, WA, when a black BMW pulled up alongside of them. According to Geske, he and his friend stopped walking when the car slowed down, assuming it was an acquaintance of theirs. When the car came to a halt, the driver burst out of the car, hurling anti-gay epithets at Geske and punching him in the face repeatedly. Reeling from the attack, Geske's arm fell through the passenger side window, where another attacker grabbed onto it. The driver then got back in the car and sped off with Geske's arm still trapped. The victim was dragged several blocks before he broke free, suffering scrapes and sprained fingers in the process. The attack is being investigated as a bias crime and the assailants are still at large.", u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/04/10/S2936-3_the-matthew-shepard-act-of-2007/'}
