That issue is global health. Men, women and children all over the world are struggling with the impact of an HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa that threatens to engulf parts of Asia over the next few years and destabilize regional security on each of these continents. The former Soviet Union has one of the most rapidly growing number of HIV/AIDS cases in the world and has already overwhelmed its already faltering health care infrastructure.", "The people of these and those in other developing countries are struggling with the fact that more than ten million children die before their 5th birthday each year from preventable diseases in developing countries. They are struggling with the continued impact of global infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, other infections that threaten their lives, the lives of their children, the viability of their villages, their economies, their national security.", "Epic threats to the health of people all over the world continue to challenge governments, domestic infrastructures and societies on a rapidly growing scale. Their crisis is our crises. The stability of the region is at risk and with that, our interests in the stability of governments in Africa.", "Despite these daunting facts, there is something we can do. Unprecedented opportunities exist today to improve health around the world and the U.S. must maintain its leadership role on these issues. It is in our interest to do so. Our borders are not impervious to these global health threats. To address these global health threats, I am introducing the Global Health Act of 2001.", "During the 106th Congress, over 75 members of Congress and 152 organizations joined me in support of the Global Health Act of 2000 and we are reintroducing this legislation this year to reaffirm our commitment to improve the health of men, women and children around the world.", "Today, I am joined by 52 of my colleagues in introducing bipartisan legislation to increase the U.S. commitment to global health by $1 billion dollars over FY 2001 appropriated levels. With these additional funds, our commitment to global health will be authorized at $2.55 billion.", "Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the fifty-two cosponsors of the Global Health Act of 2001. These cosponsors represent a broad cross section of the House; Democrats and Republicans, members of the Women's Caucus, the Progressive Caucus, the Black Caucus, Appropriators and Authorizers, who recognize the need and importance of an increased commitment to global health.", "I ask that a copy of the Global Health Act be printed in the Record following my remarks.", "We are joined in this effort by over 70 international organizations and two coalitions committed to global health, such as the Global Health Council, Save the Children, the Christian Children's Fund, and the American Foundation for AIDS Research, and the list is growing every day.", "I have included that list of the global health organizations, faith-based organizations and development NGOs that support this legislation and ask that it be entered into the Record.", "What does the Global Health Act do?", "The Global Health Act of 2001 provides an additional $1 billion to the global health programs of the Federal Government. This includes a $275 million increase for HIV/AIDS, a $100 million increase for maternal health, a $200 million increase for family planning, a $225 million increase for child survival, and a $200 million increase for infectious diseases.", "While other legislation will seek to target specific diseases, the Global Health Act understands the interconnectedness of health and seeks an increase for all of the global health programs that play an important role in improving the health of men, women and children around the world.", "It also calls for increased coordination between the different government agencies administering health programs.", "The HIV/AIDS pandemic is the greatest public health disaster to face mankind since the bubonic plaque. Already, 58 million people have been infected or died as a result of HIV/AIDS and more than 95 percent of new infections occur in developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has been the hardest hit and in South Africa it is estimated that 10 percent of its 45 million people are infected with the virus.", "But, the pandemic is not limited to Africa: Asia will soon have more new HIV infections than any other region and Russia is the new ``hot spot'' for the disease. The disease is ravaging families and communities and young people have been particularly devastated. Every minute, five young people contract HIV/AIDS somewhere in the world and in Southern Africa it is projected that more than half of today's teenagers will become infected and die of AIDS.", "UNAIDS has estimated that it would take $3 billion to address HIV/AIDS in Africa alone (excluding access to drugs) and at this time the international community is providing less than $1 billion a year for HIV/AIDS programs in the developing world.", "The world looks to the United States to be a leader and now is the time for the United States to significantly expand its support for global HIV/AIDS programs. The creation of new drugs and vaccines cannot stand alone and we must also invest in the development of public health infrastructure.", "This infrastructure will be important as we continue to expand investment in treatment and care programs. In addition, 42 million children will be orphaned by HIV/AIDS by 2010 and we must be prepared to provide good health care to these children across the health spectrum.", "All children of the world need our support. As we approach the 10-year anniversary of the World Summit for Children, we must make a strong commitment in their future by investing in the world's children. Ten million children die before their 5th birthday each year in developing countries from preventable diseases, such as pneumonia, diarrhea and measles. Yet, funding for the core child survival program remained fairly stable in the FY 2001 budget. Without additional funding, the successful child survival programs will not continue to provide needed services for young girls and boys in developing countries. Through its research and development programs, the United States has developed interventions that work. Clean water and sanitation prevent infections, and oral rehydration therapy (a simple salt sugar mixture taken by mouth, which costs only pennies) has been proven to be among the most effective public health interventions ever developed.", "Immunization programs have also proven to be successful and almost 75 percent of children are immunized today in developing countries.", "Annually, immunizations avert two million childhood deaths from measles, neonatal tetanus, and whooping cough. The success of these programs is striking and the U.S. should reaffirm its commitment to children as we meet with other world leaders at the UN Special Session for Children in September, 2001.", "Another equally compelling problem that has not yet been given the recognition it deserves is the death of 600,000 women each year during pregnancy and childbirth--one woman every minute.", "Over 80 percent of these deaths are due to complications that are routinely prevented in the developed world, such as obstructed labor, infections and unsafe births. 99 percent of these 600,000 deaths could be averted.", "Of all the health statistics monitored by the World Health Organization, the figures on materal mortality reveal the largest discrepancy between developed and developing countries.", "Women in developing countries are 18 times more likely to die during childbirth than women in developed countries. This disparity does not need to continue. The WHO has identified a package of health interventions that for a cost of $1-3 per mother, could save the lives of countless mothers and their children.", "This small investment in mothers will have an enormous impact on the families of tomorrow.", "Other interventions, such as family planning, also play a large role in protecting the integrity of a family.", "One third of the world's population is between the ages of 10 and 24. As these young people begin to raise families, the demand for safe voluntary family planning services will increase dramatically.", "Many women will choose to have children and over 200 million will become pregnant in the coming year.", "But, following the birth of a healthy child, many couples prefer to delay or cease childbearing. About a quarter of a billion couples around the world find themselves in this situation and they do not have access to voluntary contraceptive methods. As a result, many pregnancies are unplanned or unwanted.", "The World Bank has found family planning to be one of the best ways to improve maternal and child health and it is time for the U.S. to signficantly expand funding and support for the international family planning programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development and increase the U.S. allocation to the United Nations Population Fund.", "The final important piece of the Global Health Act is the increased funding for programs that address infectious diseases.", "My own district was surprised and concerned when West Nile Encephalitis entered our community during the Summer of 1999. This incident reminded us that infectious diseases know no geographic boundaries, and are crossing U.S. borders with greater frequency.", "Tuberculosis has re-emerged on the world stage in deadlier and more drug resistant forms.", "With the appearance of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and its spread to Europe and the U.S., we face the possibility that this could again become a leading killer. But, through effective collaborative projects, the United States has been able to leverage its support for infectious disease programs and rates of malaria and polio are decreasing.", "In just the past ten years, the number of polio cases worldwide has fallen by almost 50 percent and the death toll from malaria has been reduced by 97 percent. These partnerships have proven to be very fruitful and are a model for future U.S. action on infectious diseases.", "With the resources provided under the Global Health Act and the coordination and assistance of other nations, we can make a profound difference in the health and wellbeing of millions of the world's poorest citizens.", "Without good health, a nation will be unable to support a healthy and strong economy.", "It is in our national and economic interests that the U.S. support increased funding for global health so that today's healthy children can be tomorrow's healthy world partners.
