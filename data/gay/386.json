This is a major step backward for our commitment to civil rights.", "The Senate passed the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Gordon Smith, on June 20 by a strong bipartisan vote of 57-42. This legislation would strengthen current law by making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability.", "The Senate bill also shows full respect for principles of federalism. It strengthens Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. It has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country, support that is particularly significant to me as a former prosecutor.", "On September 13, the House voted 232-192 to instruct their conferees to agree to the Senate language, showing that a strong bipartisan majority of the House also wanted to strengthen and expand our laws against hate crimes.", "But the conferees have now ignored the will of both the Senate and the House. They have dropped the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which has the support of not just the Congress but the President and the American people.", "Their objection cannot be that this legislation is unimportant. Hate crimes affect more than just their victims and their victims' families--they inspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim beyond a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. When James Byrd, Jr. was dragged behind a pickup truck and killed by bigots in Texas for no reason other than his race, many African-Americans throughout the United States surely felt diminished as citizens. When Matthew Shepard was brutally murdered in Wyoming because he was gay, many gay people throughout the United States felt less safe on our streets and in their homes. These crimes promote fear and insecurity that are distinct from the reactions to other crimes, and House and Senate have both agreed that they should have distinct punishments.", "The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is unnecessary. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it diminishes our Nation. As a Nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. The hate crimes amendment this Senate approved and the House endorsed continues that great and honorable tradition.", "The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is unconstitutional. This bill accomplishes a critically important goal--protecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional responsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts of violence and threats of violence motivated by hatred and bigotry. The Constitution does not permit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because we disagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but freedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, and I am confident that this bill does not contradict it.", "The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation has not been properly examined. In addition to gaining the approval of the Senate and the House this year, similar legislation passed the Senate last year. It has been the subject of great discussion in the general public and in the halls of Congress. It is long past time to act on this legislation.", "Finally, the conferees's objection cannot be that hate crimes are rare occurrences. In addition to the terrible murders of Mr. Byrd and Mr. Shepard, the last years have seen the murder of former Northwestern basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong and others in a bigoted Illinois shooting spree, the terrible sight of small children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles fleeing a gunman who sprayed the building with 70 bullets from a submachine gun, and racially-motivated crimes in the Pittsburgh area by both African-American and white offenders. And these are just some examples of a wider phenomenon of hate-based crimes.", "I would like to thank Senators Kennedy and Gordon Smith for their exhaustive efforts on behalf of hate crimes legislation. I regret that their efforts and the will of the House and Senate have been frustrated."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/10/06/S10072_hate-crimes-legislation/"}
