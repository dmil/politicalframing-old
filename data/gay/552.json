I especially want to thank Chairman Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for his help.', u"S. 1995, introduced in the Senate by my Virginia colleague Senator John Warner, authorizes the Smithsonian to build a much-needed extension of the Air and Space Museum. The existing Air and Space Museum on the Mall is simply too small and inadequate to meet existing needs. Currently there is no storage space for large artifacts, making the safe preservation of these large artifacts quite impracticable. Furthermore, due to current space limitations at the Mall museum, only about 20 percent of the Nation's air and space collection is on public display.", u"Clearly, the extension of the Air and Space Museum at Washington Dulles International Airport will help to correct this problem. It will allow the Smithsonian to place on display historic and magnificent artifacts such as the Enola Gay, the SR-7 Blackbird spy plane, the space shuttle Enterprise, and many others. These planes and spaceships currently sit in warehouses away from public view and are improperly maintained because there is no room for these large artifacts at the Mall museum. This deprives the public of the opportunity to experience some of the most fascinating testaments to our Nation's creative genius in civil, military, and space flight.", u"The Air and Space extension will provide the space and facilities needed to display these artifacts and allow them to be enjoyed by people from all around the world. The Air and Space Museum is the most popular of the Smithsonian's museums and the extension is expected to draw over 3 million visitors per year.", u'In 1993 the Smithsonian Institution was first authorized to plan and design an Air and Space Museum extension at Washington Dulles International Airport and I was pleased to support this effort. In fiscal year 1996, Congress and the Commonwealth of Virginia in partnership provided funding for planning and design work on the extension. It is important to note that Congress has made it clear that no Federal funds are to be made available for the construction portion of the project. Instead, the Smithsonian Institution is responsible for raising private funds for the construction of the extension.', u'S. 1995 furthers the efforts already underway by authorizing the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to construct the museum extension while also making clear that no appropriated funds are to be used to pay any expense of the construction of this facility. Retired Adm. Donald Engen is the new director of the Air and Space Museum and I am pleased that the museum is headed by such an enthusiastic and able director. Admiral Engen has stated that his No. 1 priority is to wage a national campaign to raise adequate funding for construction and this goal will be accomplished more effectively once Congress has clearly authorized this construction.', u'Mr. Speaker, the museum extension will significantly increase the amount of our air and space collection on public display, provide safe and climate-controlled storage facilities, and establish a restoration facility capable of handling the largest artifacts in the collection in full view of visitors. All of this will be accomplished with no Federal funds being used for the construction of the extension. I urge passage of S. 1995 and yield back the balance of my time.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/09/18/H10548_smithsonian-institution-national-air-and-space-mus/'}
