The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.", "I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred December 12, 1999 in Washington County, PA. Three men who went to an adult bookstore to rob a gay man now face charges of kidnapping, robbery, aggravated assault, murder, tampering with evidence, and one count of conspiring to commit those crimes in the disappearance of Ira Swearingen, 49, a medical consultant from Stout, NV. The gruesome details of the abduction, beating, and murder of Swearingen were revealed in court. After being abducted, Swearingen was stuffed inside the trunk of his rental car, during which time, one of the perpetrators said ``Did ya hear it? I broke his jaw.'' Another perpetrator heard gurgling of blood and heard the victim screaming. They yelled ``Shut up faggot! Shutup, pickle.'' Later, the victim was driven to an isolated area, forced to strip and marched into the woods as he pleaded for his life at which point, one perpetrator testified, he shot the victim between the eyes at close range.", "I believe the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change hearts and minds as well."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/05/16/S5002_local-law-enforcement-act-of-2001/"}
