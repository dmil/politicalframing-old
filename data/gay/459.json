Newman, who recently died at age 85, for an inspiring life that promoted peace and social justice. He was a well-known and much loved Santa Cruzan.", "Following high school he attended the School of Engineering at the University of California Berkeley before joining the Navy to serve in World War II. As a young enlisted man, he organized a brave challenge to the status quo, resulting in dismissal of a corrupt procurement officer. This experience taught him, at an early age, that even one person can make a difference in this world. He earned a law degree from U.C. Berkeley in 1951, and used his skills as an accomplished writer, speaker, and advocate, to stand up for justice and common people.", "Ed actively promoted the causes of peace and social justice throughout his life. He vigorously opposed the Vietnam war and the invasion of Iraq. He served as president of the Castro Valley Democratic Club, and later founded and served as president of the People's Democratic Club of Santa Cruz County. He campaigned to protect the environment, abolish the death penalty, protect civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, and all human rights. As a veteran, he became active in the Santa Cruz County Chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, leading the chapter to advocate for peace, and to oppose expansion of the military-industrial complex. With intelligence and humor, he exposed political hypocrisy, writing countless letters to the editor, and contributing columns to newspapers.", "As an attorney, Ed Newman championed causes of the underdog, handling numerous pro bono matters to protect fundamental rights. He defended ordinary citizens in proceedings by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and took cases for the American Civil Liberties Union. In the 1980s, he took a pro bono case to challenge gender discrimination, resulting in the court decision which transformed the Santa Cruz Boys Club into the Santa Cruz Boys and Girls Club. He was president of the Santa Cruz County Bar Association in 1985. He was also a leader in the Starr King Unitarian Church, and he served as committee chair and president of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Santa Cruz County.", "As a civic leader and activist, Ed Newman inspired his community with his eloquence, intelligence, and tireless advocacy for justice. To his family and friends, Ed was known for his kindness, his wisdom, his outstanding cooking, and his wonderful sense of humor. With his wife Carol, he raised five children, all of whom graduated from U.C. Santa Cruz before obtaining advanced degrees in Library Science, Particle Physics, Medicine, Literature, and Law. He is survived by his wife Carol, with whom he recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, as well as his sister, five children, and ten grandchildren.", "Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I would like to express the gratitude of the whole House to Edward Newman for his legacy of courage, honesty, and love, inspiring us all to work for a better world. He will be sorely missed."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/11/02/E2683-3_honoring-edward-f-newman/"}
