Being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints myself, the only church in the history of this Nation that had an extermination order out against it by the Governor of Missouri at the time, I fully understand terrible religious prejudice. So I decry anybody on the right, or anybody supporting Judge Pickering, calling Senator Leahy or any other Democrat or any other Member of this body, to criticize their religious perspective or view.', u"But it certainly was wrong to criticize Judge Pickering's religion and his religious perspective. He is a religious, righteous man, the type of person you would want to have on the bench. And thank goodness he still will be on the bench in the district court, but he won't be able to lend his expertise and talents to the circuit court of appeals.", u'I join with the concern expressed by my colleagues here and in the House, including Democrats. The fact that an impression has been created that the Senate Judiciary Committee would impose any test, whether a religious test or an abortion litmus test, concerns me greatly.', u"Republicans refused to establish an abortion litmus test in either direction when we controlled this committee. We confirmed 377 of President Clinton's judicial nominees without imposing such a test.", u'Maybe this has something to do with the make up of the Judiciary Committee: all the members on one side of the aisle share a single view, but on the Republican side, both views are welcomed.', u'I might also add, I believe that underlying these attacks on conservative judicial nominees is the issue of abortion. If we had chosen to use that as a litmus test issue, President Clinton would have had very few judges confirmed. If that is going to be the rule, then that is a very bad thing and bad precedent to start. I was told by some of the outside groups that they do not believe anybody should serve on any court in this land who is not pro-abortion.', u'That is an extreme view. Hopefully that view will never have that much influence on this body, but, unfortunately, I think it does have an influence. I will not ever agree that the Judiciary Committee or the Senate should exercise its advice and consent responsibility in a way that makes an absolutely lock-step demand that nominees think in a particular way on any single issue. Of course, as long as the Democrats are in the majority, I cannot stop them from doing so.', u'But I can promise this: a decision to impose a litmus test will offend everyone in this country who understands and appreciates the rule of law, the independent judiciary, and the great tradition of debate and acceptance of diversity that have made our country the strong democracy it is today.', u"Although some Senators on this committee prize diversity as a standard for the confirmation process. It concerns me that some people's definition of diversity includes only those with diverse skin color or ethnicity, and then only if they agree with their liberal views.", u'Take Miguel Angel Estrada, who the President nominated 310 days ago, almost a year, Mr. President.', u'Mr. Estrada, an immigrant from Honduras with a distinguished career, would be the first Hispanic on the prestigious Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and yet I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal today that Democrats are gearing up to do to him what they did to Judge Pickering.', u'He may be a minority, but he is the wrong kind of a minority, apparently, in the eyes of some of these people. I think that is awful.', u'Clarence Thomas was a minority, but he was the wrong kind of a minority in the eyes of some of these people. That is awful.', u'Diversity appears not to include intellectual diversity--diversity of personal viewpoints or religious conviction, that have nothing to do with ability to follow the law.', u'Some of my Democrat colleagues have openly sought to introduce ideology into the judicial confirmation process, something which I repudiate. I am now concerned that the abortion litmus test would have the same effect as a religious test.', u'Indeed, most people who are pro-choice hold their position as a matter of ideology. Some even allow their chosen ideology to trump the tenets of their religion. They do so in good conscience no doubt, and I respect that.', u"But the great majority of people who are pro-life come to their positions as a result of their religious convictions. We view unborn life as sacred. We believe in the words of the Declaration of Independence that we are ``endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights'' and that among these is ``life.'' Many Americans hold this view as a religious tenet, but this view does not affect their ability to interpret the law and precedent, just as skin color does not.", u'In effect, what is ideology to my Democrat friends is a matter of religious conviction to a large portion of the American people.', u"When one Senator asked Judge Pickering about Roe versus Wade, Judge Pickering's response was unequivocally that he viewed it as the law of the land and would follow it as a judge, without regard to his private views. Surely, this should be enough. Otherwise, this will mean that no judges with private pro-life views, who derive these views from religious conviction, will ever again be confirmed in a Democrat-led Senate.", u'To impose an abortion litmus test on private views--call it ideological if you want to--is to exclude from our judiciary a large number of people of religious conviction, who are perfectly prepared to follow the law.', u'I fear this is the door this Democrat-led Senate could be opening. I can understand why people would believe that a religious test is being imposed.', u"Certainly, as a former president of the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention, Judge Pickering's nomination makes concern over a religious test understandable. The recorded attacks of the extreme left, special interest groups based on Judge Pickering's religious views are repugnant, and I do hope that my Democrat colleagues will indeed repudiate such tactics. Judge Pickering's record on the bench shows that he, in good faith, does understand the difference between the law and private views, and that he has followed the law regardless of personal beliefs.", u'Judge Pickering has never had an abortion case during his 11 years on the bench, but he has ruled on cases in which the issue of sexual privacy was involved.', u"Conveniently, opponents ignore Judge Pickering's record on gay issues. It is not surprising that Log Cabin Republicans, the largest, national gay Republican organization, recently issued a press release calling on this Committee to approve the nomination of Judge Pickering and to send it to the floor of the U.S. Senate.", u'Let me quote from the release. According to Rich Tafel, the executive director of Log Cabin Republicans:', u'Judge Pickering reiterated to me his strong belief that all Americans should be treated equally under the law, including gay and lesbian Americans, and his record as a federal judge clearly demonstrates it.', u'They go on to say:', u"Among several cases he has heard, two key cases from 1991 and 1994 demonstrated Pickering has followed the principle of equality under the law for gay Americans going back over a decade. In 1991, Pickering sharply rebuked an attorney who tried to use a plaintiff's homosexuality in a fraud trial. ``Homosexuals are as much entitled to be protected from fraud as any other human beings,'' Pickering instructed the jury. ``The fact that the alleged victims in this case are homosexuals shall not affect your verdict in any way whatsoever.'' In 1994, an anti-gay citizens group in the town of Ovett, Mississippi launched a crusade of intimidation and threats to drive out Camp Sister Spirit, a lesbian community being built by a lesbian couple. When the group took Camp Sister Spirit to court, Judge Pickering threw their case out.", u'They go on:', u"His civil rights record is long and distinguished. In 1967, Judge Pickering testified for the prosecution in a criminal hate-murder case against Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers in the death of an African American civil rights worker. When Jones County, Mississippi schools were racially integrated in the 1970's, Judge Pickering and his wife kept their children in the public school system when other white families removed their children. He was a featured speaker at Mississippi NAACP meetings as far back as 1976, when he was chairman of the Mississippi GOP. In 1981, he defended an African American man who was falsely accused of robbing a white girl at knife point, forcing the case to a second trial after a hung jury and an eventual acquittal. In 1988, he convened and chaired a bipartisan, biracial committee to promote better race relations in Jones County, Mississippi.", u'And then remarkably Tafel says:', u'The judge who threw out the anti-Camp Sister Spirit case and rebuked homophobia from the bench in the Deep South over ten years ago deserves a promotion, not a rebuke.', u'That is what Tafel said.', u"I fear that the Judiciary Committee was not as fair to Judge Pickering's record. I am greatly disappointed and profoundly concerned for our country.", u'What is now occurring is far beyond the mere tug-of-war politics that unfortunately surrounds Senate judicial confirmation since Robert Bork. My Democrat colleagues are out to effect a fundamental change in our constitutional system. Rather than seeking to determine the judiciousness of a nominee and whether a nominee will be able to rule on the law or the Constitution without personal bias, my Democrat colleagues are out to guarantee that our judges are in fact biased. And certainly no person who holds certain religious convictions need apply.', u'In the America that the Senate Democrats would reshape, citizens will have to worry about the personal politics of the judge to whom they come for justice under the law.', u"The legitimacy of our courts, and especially the Supreme Court, comes from much more than black robes and a high bench. It comes from the people's belief that judges and justices will apply a judicial philosophy without regard to personal politics or bias.", u'What my Democrat colleagues are pursuing is an end to the independence of our judiciary with unforeseeable, unintended consequences to the strength of the Republic.', u"Today is the Ides of March. I would call on my Senate colleagues to ``Beware.'' The fight they started with Judge Pickering is one that others may end. I hope, however, to quote Shakespeare further, that they have not crossed the Rubicon, that the die is not cast.", u'I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/03/15/S1965-3_nomination-of-charles-pickering-sr/'}
