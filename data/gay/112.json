The following is the statement I had prepared.', u'I have the greatest respect for the Chairman and Ranking Members of this Subcommittee and am, therefore, disappointed in the need to oppose the Conference Report, however it is deficient in several critical ways, particularly in not paying our UN debt, in not including the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and in under funding the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) program.', u'First, this Conference Report does not provide the needed funds to address one of our greatest and most immediate current foreign policy needs. The Conference Report does not provide the funding to pay our United Nations dues.', u'Great nations pay their bills. It is a travesty and a very poor reflection on this institution that the United States has fallen more than $1 billion behind in our payments to the U.N.', u'Today, we could and should be solving this problem. However, the Republican leadership has chosen, instead, to allow this important international obligation to be held hostage to the domestic politics of the far-right by continuing the connection between U.N. dues and the unrelated issue of restrictions on international family planning.', u"There are many consequences to the U.S. not paying its UN bills. Most immediately, if we do not pay a significant portion of our arrears this year, we will automatically lose our vote in the General Assembly. I cannot believe that this Congress could even consider allowing such a step to occur--but, unfortunately, it has done so repeatedly in the past few years and there is a real possibility that it will again this year. In light of the majority's recent rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the Senate, not paying our UN dues marches this Congress further down the path of neo-isolationism.", u'We used to be told by our colleagues who oppose the UN that their objections to UN funding were based on concerns about inefficiencies and bureaucracy at the UN. Those issues have been and continue to be addressed. The UN is reforming. We use our leverage to continue those reforms when we continue as a deadbeat in our dues.', u'Now, of course, our U.N. dues have not been paid because they are being held hostage to a totally unrelated matter--the Mexico City gag rule and the politics of the religious right on the other side of the aisle. It is long past time for this to stop and for the United States to live up to its international obligations.', u"The people of San Francisco, who I am honored to represent here in Congress, understand the importance of the United Nations. Our great City is the birthplace of the UN--the UN's Founding Charter was signed in San Francisco over 50 years ago. San Francisco's interest in the UN goes well beyond our historical connections to the institution. San Franciscans take seriously the principles and the ideals behind the UN, including the belief that a multinational institution can play a valuable role in conflict resolution and the promotion of peace.", u'I believe that the U.S. has a national interest in a reformed United Nations that functions effectively and efficiently. We must provide it with the needed resources.', u'The second major problem with this Conference Report is the removal by the Conference Committee of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.', u'One year ago, many of us spoke on this floor about the tragic and brutal murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student. Matthew was courageously willing to be open about who he was. He suffered because of who he was. This is simply wrong.', u'Unfortunately, Matthew is not alone. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence programs, in 1998, 33 Americans were murdered because they were gay or lesbian. In the United States last year, there were at least 2,552 reports of anti-gay or lesbian incidents. The number of serious assaults in which victims sustained major injuries grew by 12%.', u'Hate crimes take many forms and affect many different kinds of victims. We all remember the horrible murder last year of James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man in Texas. We all remember earlier this year, when a gunmen opened fire at a Jewish Community Center and then singled out an Asian American and shot him. How many more deaths, how many assaults on the personal integrity of people, need to happen before this Congress will see the need for hate crimes legislation?', u'The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would provide law enforcement officials with needed tools to fight these crimes, and would serve as a lasting tribute to the lives of Matthew Shepard, James Byrd, Jr., and the others who have been victimized by hate crimes. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would not end all violence against people because they are gay, or African-American, or Jewish, or come from another country. Nonetheless, this legislation would allow the federal government to investigate and punish crimes motivated by hate. If this law prevents one hate-driven death, it will be justified.', u'The murder of Matthew Shepard is the manifestation of the enduring bigotry that still prevails in our society. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act should be included in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill.', u"I also believe that this Conference Report is deficient because it provides only $325 million for the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) program. This funding level is a cut of $1.1 billion below last year's funding and $950 million below the President's request. This cut is wrong. The COPS program has been successful in adding officers to local law enforcement agencies and has had a real impact on preventing crime and promoting neighborhood and community safety.", u'Because the CJS Conference Report does not pay our UN debt, because it does not contain the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, because it inadequately funds the COPS programs, and for other short-comings in important programs, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Conference agreement.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/11/01/E2230-2_opposition-to-the-conference-report-on-fiscal-year/'}
