I see my good friend, Joe Kennedy, is on the floor of the House, and I was not able to pay tribute to him along with my colleague, Representative Henry Gonzalez, and I just wanted them both to know, and I hope to extend my remarks in the Record, how much I appreciate their leadership for the Nation. Mr. Kennedy has been long known as an advocate for the least of those and particularly as he has helped in dollars to assist those seniors without the resources to give them good heating in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, and that is a tough place to be in. So I thank him for his leadership, his kindness, his recognition that the voiceless need a voice.", "And then there is nothing more to be said about our senior leader in the Texas delegation, Henry Gonzalez, who has for years been a fighter on equal opportunity and home buying in America. He, too, has lifted up those who are voiceless. He is a giant of a person with kindness and dignity, and we wish him well, and we wish my good friend, Joe Kennedy, well as they retire from this body.", "Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about what we can do in these last waning hours, and that is why I am here today, because certainly there are many issues in my district. We have just faced flooding about a month or so ago, and many of my constituents are trying to rebuild their homes. There is a great need for modernization of our schools, and so there is a lot that we, as Members of Congress, could be doing in our local communities. But I would like to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that we can actually do some good here.", "There is no reason, Mr. Speaker, why we cannot pass the school modernization legislation that allows us to rebuild our crumbling schools so that schools like those in my district whose roofs are falling in, the wiring is not good, we can actually bring tax relief locally by providing tax credits for those constituents who are putting in bonds in order to rebuild their schools. We can do that.", "Mr. Speaker, we can have a real actual collaboration on the census. We understand that sampling is documented by the National Academy of Sciences, the National Foundation of Sciences, which indicate that sampling is the best and accurate way to count the 2000 census. We can still do that, Mr. Speaker.", "And frankly I think that we can answer our constituents on the question of a good Patient Bill of Rights. We can do that. We can balance the rights of physicians and patients. We can overcome the burden of HMOs who tell you that you cannot get the service at this emergency room or you cannot continue with this doctor. We can do that, Mr. Speaker.", "We can help the home health care agencies. We can tell them that the interim payment system that is brutalizing them, keeping them from keeping our seniors in their homes with their children and protecting them a way from the hospital system or the nursing home, we can get a better system for those small agencies, and I am determined to do so.", "And finally, Mr. Speaker, something I would like to talk about that I know America can do because America is a land of equality and good conscience and good-faith. We can pass the Hate Crimes Protection Act. Matthew Shepard should not die in vain, and neither should James Baird, and I believe that we who believe, who are believers, as well as those who want to offer the secular reasons for doing so, even if you may disagree with the beliefs that you think Matthew Shepard represented, he is a human being, and he was killed because of his sexual orientation and because of his difference.", "James Baird was killed and dismembered, beheaded in Texas, because he was black. There is no reason why we cannot pass a Hate Crimes Protection Act of 1998 that protects the disabled, it protects you if your religion is different, if your race is different, if your gender is different, if your sexual orientation is different.", "We have had some 21 members of the gay lesbian community killed in this Nation because of their difference, and 10,000 hate crimes in this Nation. One person who testified in our hearings in the Committee on the Judiciary said very clearly, ``I am not gay, but because it was perceived that I was gay, I was brutally beaten.''", "Do we want to have a Nation that fights China on human rights grounds, that fights countries in Africa on human rights ground, and yet not stand up and be counted here on the basic human decency of not beating somebody so brutally, hitting them over the head that you crush their skull, leaving like a scarecrow on a fence?", "This is not about Wyoming. This is not about the good people of Wyoming or the good people in Texas or the good people in Ohio or the good people in Washington, DC. It is about a Federal standard that insists on human decency. It is about the fact that we have only 40 states that have passed their laws, that Wyoming has defeated hate crimes laws three times, that Texas hate crimes laws were so weak that we could not even prosecute those who dismembered Mr. Baird, and we may have a problem prosecuting those in Wyoming.", "Let us do the right thing and pass the hate crimes protection act and all the other good initiatives that the American people want."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/14/H10878-3_many-issues-for-the-waning-hours-of-the-105th-cong/"}
