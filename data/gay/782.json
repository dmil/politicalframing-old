It is not often that we hear about people who some consider heroes. And when we do hear about heroes, they are usually sports figures who make millions or actors who have access to media attention.", "But I recently heard about a Montanan that is neither an athlete, an actor, or any national figure. He has not saved lives or discovered a new drug. In fact, I would venture to bet that most people inside this beltway have never heard of him. And yet, he is a hero just the same.", "His name is Roger Arpan, he is 39 years old and he lives in Alzada, MT. And recently he made such an impact on the life of a man in Alaska, that I received a letter commending him.", "I would like to read a portion of this letter, because it spells out so clearly why Roger is worthy of our attention:", "I met Roger by accident when my nephew and I were in the area in mid-October for an antelope hunt. We were on Highway 212 just north of Alzada when we spotted a nice herd of animals well off the road in a very large pasture. We knew it was private property and went to find the owner to ask permission to hunt. After a bit of searching, we found a road that led to the ranch house. A man promptly came out of the house; his arms flaying in the air, his head was bobbing around and he was walking with an irregular gait. Soon he addressed us in a halting fashion. We asked if we could get permission to hunt, and he said, ``Yes, but watch out for livestock, and if you are not successful, come back and I'll help you get some.'' He also said he would be working in a distant back field collecting rolls of hay and stacking them in the field. We returned to the pasture and after laying some careful stalking strategy, we collected a fine buck antelope with 15\\1/2\\ inch horns. As a matter of courtesy, we returned to the ranch house to let the owners know of our success. This time Roger was out in the big hay field, but he drove across to meet us at the gate. There he was operating a large farm truck and trailer hauling hay and driving a tractor with a stacker, putting up the hay for winter feed all by himself. His body motions may have seemed erratic to me, but Roger was in complete control of himself and the equipment. I have farmed nearly all my life and understand the requirement for dexterity and alertness when operating heavy farm machinery. I could not restrain myself and had to express my admiration for Roger for his courage and determination in carrying out these farming activities despite obvious and severe physical limitations. It was then that I learned that Roger Arpan was born with cerebral palsy and has suffered the ravages of this disease all his life. His parents determined early on that if Roger was to have any kind of life, he had to learn to take care of himself. Roger suffers every day, now somewhat less than in past years due to a new treatment, but the disease is chronic and will be with him all his life unless a cure is discovered. He carries on with courage and determination, motivated by the love and support of his family. He is disabled in his physical body but his mind is alert and he is out there working and making a contribution to his family and to society. Many people suffering disabilities far less acute than Roger's fall into despair and become burdens on society, but not this man.", "Mr. President, I join with Wilson Gay, this man from Alaska, in saluting Roger Arpan. Though I would like to believe Roger is a typical Montanan, I know that he stands out. His strength, his courage, his determination, his strong character, and yes, even his success, make Roger a hero. Keep up the good work, Roger. I tip my hat to you."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/02/06/S998-2_roger-arpan/"}
