In the photograph, snapped 89 years ago, a vast Dallas mob of 10,000, many of them children, stand shoulder to shoulder around Brooks, a black man. He was lynched from a telephone pole in downtown Dallas. The execution is ``one of the great tragedies ever to occur in Dallas,'' said local journalist and historian Darwin Payne. All that remains in the city's memory is an original postcard at the Dallas Public Library and a few old newspaper clippings. Until now, the event in March 1910 has not been publicly viewed as worthy of investigation or academic reflection. But that would change if some scholars and city officials have their way. They say the city of Dallas should commission a study to investigate the incident if only because Brooks' guilt is doubtful and no mob leaders were ever held responsible. The 68-year-old Dallas man was to have stood trial on never- proved charges of molesting a white 3-year-old girl. ``It's not in the nature of Dallas historians to do research on that sort of topic,'' said Bill Farmer, a historian and professor emeritus of theology at Southern Methodist University. ``That's true of Southern regions in general and the tendency to bemoan bad things that happened but then to forget them. And Dallas has a particularly bad case of this. ``But I think there is a readiness now. I think the time is right.'' Kenneth Hamilton, a professor of history at SMU, points to recent efforts to unearth the truth about long-buried cases of killings of blacks, such as massacres in Rosewood, Fla., and Forsyth, Ga., and the Tulsa, Okla., race riots. In Tulsa, a city commission is reconstructing the 1921 melee set off by a rape charge against a black man. Local blacks want reparations. ``We don't have an urban historian on campus who does Dallas history. There's no conspiracy; we just have people whose interests lay elsewhere, and that's not unusual,'' said Dr. Hamilton of SMU, who is black. ``Blacks were not important to Dallas until recently. So if it's important to Dallas, then Dallas can commission someone to do it.'' As the State and Nation cope with the modern-day trial in Jasper, TX, of a white supremacist convicted of dragging a black man to death, historians recall an earlier time of such acts. Small-town Texas contributed to the annals of Southern mob lynchings from post-slavery Reconstruction through the 1920's and 1930's. But few such incidents anywhere were as urban, well- attended or festive as the mob killing of Brooks in downtown Dallas, historians say. The only thing that anyone knows for certain is that Brooks never got his day in a big-city court. According to newspaper accounts, Brooks was found in a barn with Mary Ethel Huvens, a 3-year-old who had been missing. He was accused of molesting her and arrested in late February ", "Rights Leaders Say Laws Nationwide Targeting Hate Crimes Have Been ", "Knight Ridder Newspapers (KRT) Miami--Prosecuting hate isn't easy. Although Florida's hate crimes law is one of the toughest in the nation, the number of defendants actually prosecuted under the 10-year-old statute remains relatively low, prosecutors say, because the standard is often difficult to prove. ``What you have to prove is that but for the fact that the victim was not a member of a certain group, the crime would not have happened,'' said prosecutor Charles Morton, a homicide supervisor in Broward, where a murder last week may have been a case of racial hatred run amok. Still, civil rights leaders said, laws nationwide targeting hate crimes have been effective. ``We can't prove the negative, meaning we can't prove what hate crimes did not occur because of the law,'' said Arthur Teitelbaum, Southern Area director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ``But we know that the Florida law is well known to the haters and the bigots, and they fear its consequences.'' For Robert Boltuch, the man accused this week of the Feb. 24 killing of Jody-Gaye Bailey, being charged with a hate crime won't help or hinder his case because he already faces the most severe penalty for his alleged actions: If he is formally charged with first-degree murder and convicted, Boltuch faces either life in prison without parole or the death penalty. Boltuch has yet to be charged by the Broward state attorney's office. ``When you're dealing with Murder One, hate doesn't elevate it any further,'' Morton said. ``The defendant is facing either life or death.'' Florida's hate crimes law is used to elevate the seriousness and penalty associated with a crime. That is, a defendant cannot be charged independently with a hate crime; rather, the charge is added to an existing crime, such as aggravated assault or battery. Being charged with a hate crime can bump a misdemeanor up to a felony and, if a defendant is convicted, can mean the difference between probation and prison. The law cannot be used to enhance a noncapital crime to one where the defendant would face the death penalty. The hate element also cannot be used as an ``aggravator,'' or a factor that jurors could consider in a death penalty case. Although statistics show hate crimes nationwide have declined, glaring incidents like Bailey's death have made headlines. The names and the incidents are chilling and have gripped the public's worst fears about violence against minorities: James Byrd, a black man tied to a truck and dragged to his death by a white supremacist in Jasper, Texas; Matthew Shepard, a University of Wyoming student beaten to death because he was gay; and the Feb. 19 beating death of Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man in Alabama. Teitelbaum's group drafted the hate crimes law and was instrumental in getting it passed by the Legislature in 1989. The law was challenged as unconstitutional, with critics saying it targeted attitudes and speech rather than behavior. But a Broward case became the model in a state Supreme Court ruling that the hate crimes law is constitutional. Fort Lauderdale defense attorney Herb Cohen was physically and verbally attacked by Richard Stalder in 1991 after going to Stalder's home to retrieve earrings for a female friend. Stalder answered the door, stating: ``Hey Jew boy, what do you want?'' and repeatedly made derogatory comments about Cohen's ancestry. Stalder was charged with battery against Cohen, and when the two appeared in court, Stalder continued to assault Cohen with antisemitic slurs. Circuit Judge J. Leonard Fleet dismissed the charges against Stalder, saying the hate crimes law was unconstitutional. But the state Supreme Court reversed Fleet in 1994. Former Chief Justice Gerald Kogan in the opinion wrote: ``I do not dispute that people have a right to hold intolerant and bigoted opinions. But that is a far different matter than saying they have a right to act upon those opinions. . . . Criminal motive is not and never has been a protected form of expression.'' Stalder later accepted a plea deal and received probation. Cohen said Friday that the standard of proof is fair and appropriate. ``These cases can be difficult to prosecute, and, in a sense, I guess they should be,'' Cohen said. ``It shouldn't be easy to prosecute someone for what they say. But if the criminal act was motivated by race or religion, then it should be prosecuted as a hate crime.'' Defendants charged with hate crimes in South Florida can be hit with a double-whammy in state and federal court. Local state law-enforcement agencies have worked closely with the United States Attorney's Office and the FBI to impose the harshest penalties on both levels. Defendants face criminal charges in state court and prosecution for civil rights violations in federal court. Eighteen-year-old Raymond Leone, for example, faces up to 30 years in prison on state and federal charges after pleading guilty to two separate incidents in which he targeted the victims because of their race and religious backgrounds. He and several others affiliated with the white-separatist group World Church of the Creator beat a Hispanic father and son for refusing to accept racist literature outside a rock concert in Sunrise in 1997. Leone also robbed and beat the owner of an adult video store in Hollywood because the man is Jewish. Teitelbaum said the laws continue to punish ugly incidents of hatred. ``We saw the need to have an effective legislative response, a tool for law enforcement to prosecute these crimes because of their specific nature and impact,'' he said. ``The victim is impacted, and every person in the victim's group is threatened and traumatized. ``American history, unfortunately, has been stained by these hate crimes,'' he said."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/04/29/E815-3_exposing-racism/"}
