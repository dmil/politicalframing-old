Mr. McBride's contributions to the Tampa Bay community, the State of Florida, and the country are worthy of recognition by all.", u'Born on May 10, 1945, Mr. McBride moved to Florida at the age of 9 and spent most of his childhood in Leesburg, Florida where he attended high school and distinguished himself on the football field as a fullback and linebacker. While attending the University of Florida on a football scholarship, his football career was derailed by a knee injury. Mr. McBride then turned to public service, becoming an active member in Florida Blue Key honor society and president of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.', u"At the height of the Vietnam War, Mr. McBride dropped out of law school and enlisted in the U.S. Marines. He volunteered for combat duty, rose to the rank of captain, and was awarded a Bronze Star with a Combat V for valor for his wartime service. After returning from Vietnam, Mr. McBride finished law school. At that time, he became a civic leader in such organizations as the United Way and the Florida Holocaust Museum. He also became a managing partner of Holland and Knight, one of Florida's largest law firms.", u'Bill McBride was a force for good in the Tampa Bay community and a strong advocate for public education and civil rights in Florida. As a gubernatorial candidate in 2002, he championed smaller class sizes, greater support for teachers, and encouraged greater investment in education. Throughout his life he promoted equality in Florida as well, advocating for the survivors of the Rosewood racial massacre, pro bono legal work, and gay rights. His mission in life was to serve Florida, and he accomplished that in innumerable ways. His selfless dedication to our community and State will be greatly missed.', u'The Tampa Bay community is proud to recognize Bill McBride for his lifelong dedication to improving the lives of Floridians. His outstanding commitment to the State made him an inspirational community leader. I ask that you and all Americans recognize such a remarkable citizen for his service to our community and our State.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2013/01/23/E50-3_honoring-bill-mcbride/'}
