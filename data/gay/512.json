This amendment would deny all Federal education funding to any school district or state education agency that has been found to ``discriminate'' against the Boy Scouts of America, or any other youth group that denies membership to gays and lesbians. The Hilleary amendment is an unnecessary, unwarranted intrusion into a local school district's ability to set standards for the use of their own facilities, and bestows uopn the Boy Scouts and other youth groups unique rights that are not available to student-led groups. The amendment is unnecessary because the First Amendment already guarantees the Boy Scouts the right to use public school facilities, to the same extent and in the same manner as any other group allowed to use those facilities. At the same time, the amendment is an unwarranted intrusion into the decision-making of local school boards because it mandates the creation of an ``open forum'' any time a school lets one community group use their facilities. The Hilleary amendment decrees that such an action transforms the school into an ``open forum,'' therefore requiring the institution to allow the Boy Scouts and any other anti-gay youth group to use school facilities or premises--regardless of the school's intention or the local school board's decisions on the matter. We, the undersigned organizations, strongly urge you to oppose this amendment. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Nancy Zirkin, Director of Public Policy and Government Relations--American Association of University Women (AAUW) or Jamie Pueschel, Government Relations Manager--AAUW.
