Mr. Best recalls the first time, twenty five years ago when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control informed the world about a disease that claimed the lives of five homosexual men in California. From then on, this mysterious disease became known as the ``gay cancer'' and was considered as an immediate sentence for death.", u'Since then, HIV/AIDS has been responsible for over 25 million deaths worldwide, and the Caribbean Islands have had nothing short of a personal encounter with the disease, as HIV/AIDS claimed 20,000 lives in the region. The most affected countries in the Caribbean have consistently been Haiti, the Bahamas, Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago.', u"Mr. Best quotes U.S. HIV/AIDS expert Dr. Wayne Greaves as stating that ``Looking back on what has happened in the 25 years, the picture is still not a bright one.'' Despite all the innovative treatments that now prolong the lives of HIV/AIDS patients, there is still no cure or even a drug that prevents HIV in the first place.", u'Another very noteworthy point that Mr. Best emphasizes is that HIV/AIDS, while first distinguished as a homosexual, white, male disease, has now become blind to sexual orientation, gender, and race as it is alarmingly spreading and infecting increasing numbers of Blacks and heterosexual women. Although current census places Blacks as accounting for 12 per cent of the U.S. population, they also account for a whopping 51 per cent of the new HIV cases in the nation. Furthermore, the diagnosed HIV cases for women have tripled since first cases in 1985.', u'Mr. Best cites possible theories that may explain these surprising shifts in HIV infection such as low rate of uncircumcised Black males compared with whites, the large Black prison population, and poverty. In essence, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has completely transformed in nature with regards to who is primarily infected by the disease. Akin to the shift in the face of the HIV/AIDS epidemic exists the fact that the HIV virus is able to mutate so easily, making it virtually impossible for scientists to develop a vaccine against the disease.', u"Nevertheless, Mr. Best cites Dr. Greaves as commenting that while the cure to HIV is a ``far way off,'' in the meanwhile, scientist can still continue to develop medications that can prolong life. This point is well taken in light of the fact that there is no cure for diabetes and hypertension, and yet, science has been able to treat people with these diseases to the point where the public no longer sees them as terminal conditions. Dr. Greaves underscores education and access to beneficial drugs as key elements in the fight against HIV/AIDS.", u"To some, it was the disease from hell, the ``gay cancer,'' that brought death. To others, it was an unfathomable plague whose origins were first believed to be in Haiti. That was a discredited medical theory scarred a nation, forcing millions from the Caribbean country to fight back to clear their name. To yet another group, the lethal virus that terrorized communities in North America, Europe, the Caribbean and Latin America, is still wreaking havoc, especially in Africa, but much less so in North America and the Caribbean. The disease: HIV/AIDS. Twenty five years after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control first told the world in a 1981 report about the deaths of five homosexuals in California from a rare form of pneumonia, few countries, if any have been spared the ferocity if this deadly disease. Some 25 million deaths later, at least 20,000 of them in Haiti, the Bahamas, Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, and their neighbors, the world is grappling with the devastation HIV/ AIDS has left behind. The Bahamas and Barbados, for instance, are considered success stories in dealing with it, have had more than its fair share of deaths. ``Looking back on what has happened in the 25 years, the picture is still not a bright one,'' said Dr. Wayne Greaves, a Caribbean scientist and an HIV/AIDS expert in the U.S. For one thing, asserts Dr. Greaves who heads a research laboratory at a large U.S. pharmaceutical firm, ``we can argue it is brighter than before, because there are newer and more effective drugs.'' Even more important, scientists know how to block some, not all, infections that attack the immune functions within the body. Still, there is no drug, which prevents HIV infection in the first place. ``From the epidemiological standpoint it is particularly disconcerting, particularly among Blacks and Hispanics,'' he said. ``In the early days of the epidemic, 95 per cent of the total cases were among men. Two-thirds of those cases were among Caucasians. Blacks made up 20 per cent of the cases. Today, although Blacks account for 12 per cent of the U.S. population they account for 51 per cent of the new HIV cases. For women, the story today isn't very good. The cases diagnosed in the U.S. have increased dramatically among women, tripling among women. From eight per cent in 1985 women accounted for 29 percent of all the cases. It is even higher today.'' The hard part is that the pattern of the diseases in Caribbean countries mirrors the trend in the U.S. Globally, more than three million died in 2004 and of the 40 million who succumbed to the disease since 1981, Africa accounted for half of them. In sub-Sahara Africa alone 25.8 million are living with HIV, a 75 per cent jump in the last decade. Sub- Sahara Africa has the world highest rate of infection followed by the Caribbean. In Asia, 8.3 million are living with the disease, an increase of almost 300 per cent since 1981. Indeed, 25 per cent of the new worldwide cases were in Asia last year. In Latin America and the Caribbean an estimated 2.1 million now have the disease, a 75 per cent increase from 1995. ``What is really very troubling in the United States is the high rate of infection among Black men, who are having sex with other men and many are also having sex with women,'' said Dr. Greaves. ``'This is really very troubling.'' How come such growing infections among Black men? ``It's not really quite clear what's happening,'' Greaves said. For instance, the causes range from a lack of knowledge about their own HIV status and then having sex with other people; low rate of uncircumcised Black males compared with whites; the prevalence of sex workers in Africa and the Caribbean; and the large Black prison population; to mistrust of the medical community; poverty and conspiracy theories. ``In summary, we are now talking about a different epidemic than the one first reported in 1981,'' Greaves, explained. ``It is more heterosexual transmission than before; less homosexual; transmission through injection drug use remains the same; and a lot more women infected than in the early days of the epidemic.'' But what about treatment? If there is a bright spot, it is that HIV positive individuals are living longer, many are leading normal lives, and infection is no longer seen as a death sentence, and that's true if you are in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, New York, Nassau or Port of Spain where retroviral drugs. ``I am optimistic from the medical and scientific standpoint in terms of the new medicines and drugs but I am not optimistic at all about the behavioral response to the messages which have been put out there in the public arena,'' he said. On the horizon, some promising categories of drugs. One is entry-inhibitors, which block the virus from being able to enter the cells of the body, thus causing infections. The other is an enzymes used by the virus to infect the cell. By blocking the enzymes scientists interrupt the process of the virus multiplying and causing destruction of the cell, spawning new viruses. ``These are being developed and they look very promising,'' he reported. ``If these successes continue, they would be useful additions to the existing drugs that we use to treat AIDS.'' Unfortunately, though, current research is unlikely to lead to a class of drugs anytime soon that would prevent infection. In essence, a cure is a far way off. The problem is that the HIV virus is able to mutate so easily that scientists have been virtually unable to develop a vaccine that stimulates the right antibodies or cells that would prevent infection. ``In the meantime, though, we will continue to develop better drugs and we can still prolong life,'' Greaves said. ``We may not be able to cure the infection but we can keep people alive.'' After all, there's no cure for diabetes and hypertension but ``'we have effective drugs where people can go living virtually a normal life span,'' he says. Dr. Greaves gives several Caribbean nations high marks for their efforts in fighting HIV through education and the provision of drugs to victims."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/14/E1143-3_hivaids-today-claims-a-more-diverse-group-of-victi/'}
