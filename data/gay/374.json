On a tree nearby, you would also see a note that reads, ``United We Stand. Never be forgotten. Always to be loved. A symbol of silence that needs to be broken.''", "That memorial has been erected outside the home of Clinton Scott Risetter, 37, the victim of a hate crime.", "On February 24, 2002, Clint Risetter awoke in his apartment engulfed in flames and then tried to escape as he was burning. When firefighters arrived, they found him dead on his patio. Two days later, Martin Thomas Hartmann walked into the Santa Barbara Police Department and admitted to entering Clint's apartment, pouring gasoline on him as he slept, and then setting him on fire.", "Martin Hartmann had known Clint for several months but had learned just recently that Clint was gay. He told police about his hatred toward gays and how he ``. . . decided to put [Clint] out of his misery,'' because he was gay. He believed that he was doing the right thing and that Clint deserved to die.", "The note on the tree outside Clint Risetter's apartment expresses not only the views of its author, but also the views of the more than 500 people that joined together Monday night in Santa Barbara to light candles in a vigil for Clint. One of the vigil's attendees, Russ Chaffin, said, ``I can't be silent. This is my community. I cannot stand it that something like this could happen in my community.''", "I simply cannot stand silent when such a violent act is committed against an innocent person. I was deeply saddened and disturbed to hear the horrific details of Clint's death. It's hard for me to imagine a more heinous act of hatred than to set another human being on fire. Unfortunately, Clint's death is characteristic of many hate crimes in America; where an attacker repeatedly beats, stabs or severely burns his victim as if he is removing whatever it is he hates out of the person. And the attacker feels justified in doing so, as if he is doing a great service to humanity by killing the person.", "In California, I have seen, first-hand, the devastating impact hate crimes have on victims, their families and their communities. A hate crime divides neighborhoods and breeds a sense of mistrust and fear within a community, just like it has in Santa Barbara. This is why I have long supported legislation aimed at protecting citizens from crimes based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation.", "According to the FBI's latest statistics, hate crimes based on sexual orientation rose every year between 1994 and 2000. Yet, current Federal hate crimes law does not include crimes against others because of sexual orientation. It only covers crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. The current law also limits Federal hate crime prosecutions to instances in which the victim was targeted because he or she was exercising one of six narrowly defined federally-protected activities, such as serving on a jury, voting, attending a public school, eating at a restaurant or lodging at a hotel.", "The limitations of current law prevent it from reaching many cases where individuals are killed or injured by just walking down the street, or, as we have now seen, even sleeping in their own homes. It does not extend basic civil rights protections to every American, only to a few and under certain circumstances. Updating the current law would not provide special rights, it would ensure equal protection.", "``The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001,'' legislation of which I am an original cosponsor, would expand current Federal protections against hate crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin; amend the criminal code to cover hate crimes based on gender, disability, and sexual orientation; authorize grants for State and local programs designed to combat and prevent hate crimes; and enable the federal government to assist State and local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.", "Final passage of ``The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001,'' is long overdue. It is necessary for the safety and well being of millions of Americans. No American should have to live in fear because of his or her disability. No American should be afraid to walk down the street for fear of a gender-motivated attack. And certainly, no American should be afraid to sleep in their own home because of his or her sexual orientation.", "We have had strong bipartisan support for this legislation in the past, and it continues to receive bipartisan support. We just have not been able to get it to the President's desk for his consideration. Today, I ask all of my colleagues to work to ensure that this legislation is not simply supported, but actually gets passed and signed into law. Let's send a signal to Clint Risetter's family, and to all Americans, that our nation will no longer turn a blind eye to hate crimes in this country."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/03/08/S1702-4_hate-crimes-why-we-cant-wait/"}
