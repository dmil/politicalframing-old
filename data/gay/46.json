Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor on many occasions to highlight a separate violent, hate-motivated crime that has occurred in our country.', u"On the evening of July 7, 2008, Rev. Louis Braxton, Jr., was returning to the shelter he runs for transgender and gay youth in Queens, NY, when he witnessed a group of teens attacking some of the shelter's residents. Father Braxton says he shouted at the attackers and they ran off. Four of them returned, however, holding a paint bucket, steel brackets, a miter box, and a belt. According to the Queens district attorney's office, two of the residents argued with the four attackers and were punched in the face and body. Father Braxton, who was also reportedly struck in the face with a metal object in the scuffle, says the assailants were yelling homophobic and antitransgender slurs as they beat the victims. The shelter apparently suffers from weekly attacks from neighborhood teenagers. Father Braxton has met with the Hate Crimes Division of the police department to discuss safety issues for the residents. The district attorney's office has charged Shara Mozie, Tyreek Childs, and Trevaughn Payne with assault and weapons harassment, and the attack is also being investigated as a hate crime.", u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/07/17/S6930_the-matthew-shepard-act-of-2007/'}
