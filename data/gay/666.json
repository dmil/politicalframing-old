This week they are participating in the National Scout Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia. This year's Jamboree carries on a long tradition, where just steps from the Capitol Building, the first ever Jamboree was held on the National Mall in 1937. Over the years, the Jamboree has become the pinnacle of all Scouting camps.", "Every 4 years or so, Troops descend from all over America to celebrate the tenets they all hold dear and to develop even further the life lessons Scouting is so effective in teaching. The entire process has traditionally done an outstanding job in molding boys into outstanding young men, while building character and instilling notions of personal responsibility, all of which have helped make America the envy of civilized nations.", "This year's Jamboree also holds special significance because 2010 marks the 100 year anniversary of Scouting in America. Over this period they have grown into a premier youth organization and had very positive effects on millions of young males.", "Individual Boy Scouts throughout Scouting's 100 year history have gone on to do great things and serve our country in manners that have brought great honor and credit to the United States. More than 50 percent of all NASA Astronauts were Boy Scouts. More than 30 percent of graduates from the Military, Air Force and Naval Academies were involved in Scouting in their youth and five of our Presidents were once Boy Scouts. Even within Congress, 199 of our current Members once participated in Scouting, with 22 achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. America is truly a better nation because of Scouting.", "As an Eagle Scout and Member of Congress, I can truly say that the wisdom and leadership I gained in Boy Scouts still benefit me every day. All those who take up the mantle of effective Scouting can be identified by the traits named in the Scout Law as ``trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.'' If America is going to continue to be great then, in the paraphrased words of Alex de Tocqueville, America must continue to be good. The Scouting doctrines clearly assist in making America ``good.''", "If we continue to see the young people in America living a morally sound life following the tenets supported by 100 years of Boy Scouting while dedicated to family values and country, then surely God will continue to bless America as He has during the last 100 years. To that end, the words from the Scout's Oath are as meaningful today as they were throughout Scouting's rich history:", "On my honor, I will do my best To do my duty to God and my country; To obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.", "Participating in this, the historic Boy Scout Jamboree of the United States during the I00th Anniversary of the Boy Scouts, are the following Boy Scouts from the 1st Congressional District of Texas: Thomas Alberts, Brian Allen, Beathan Andersen, William Arnold, Alex Baker, Peter Ball, Rusty Bell, Zachariah Brown, Nate Cargile, Christopher Carlin, Hartley Coker, Paul Cook, Robert Cooper, Brian Cousineau, Carter Crump, Charlie Cullen, Myles Elbel, Michael Fedell, Michael Fedun, Joshua Fields, Chris Finlay, Danny Fisher, Garett Froats, Bryan Gilliland, Jacob Gage, Kyle Gage, Wyatt Gay, David Gean, Thomas Gunn, Rielly Hassell, Clint Hearn, Stratton Hibbs, Kaleb Hively, Trent Hood, Jacob Houck, Luke Hughes, Brian Humphreys, Andrew Kazlow, Kerrigan Keele, Nicholas Kottwitz, Francis Gene Lewis, Trevor Ligon, Garrett Manning, Noah Morrill, Koehler Munoz, Payton Myers, Kacee Newman, Taylor O'Bryant, Richard Olds, James Olson, James Pike, Lyle Potter, Tyler Reed, Blake Richey, John Hunter Sattler, Jack Schaeffer, Brady Schuh, Colbert Sheard, Jeremiah Slaughter, Spencer Smith, Brandon Spears, James Tyler Stricklin, Connor Tate, Travis Tate, John Timaeus, Andrew Walker, Jeffrey Dylan Watson, Elliot West, John West, Robert Westmoreland, Mason Wheeler, Zach Ziegelgrube.", "In addition, these Scouts of which their U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert is immensely proud, as should be the Nation itself, the following outstanding leaders have participated to lead these wonderful young men to the fulfillment of this scouting dream are the following: Paul Dunaway, Rory Hassell, Stephen Head, Jeffrey Jones, Matt Lindsey, Chris Peurifoy, Lyle Potter, Jim Reed, Greg Tate, Clinton Willbanks, Geoffrey Willbanks.", "The foregoing Boy Scouts and leaders have, by their demonstrated excellence and zeal, not only expanded their horizons and abilities, but they have also made it possible to create a better world in which to live for all those who follow hence. Accordingly, their names and participation are hereby memorialized in the Congressional Record of the United States of America to bear witness of their valiant participation to all those who may draw near. May God bless every one of these fine individuals just as He has so richly blessed these United States of America to this time."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/07/29/E1474-3_tribute-to-the-boy-scouts-from-texas-1st-district-/"}
