Midge was outspoken and altruistic, passionate, witty and direct. You always knew where you stood with Midge and, whether you agreed with her or not, you valued her perspective and enjoyed being around her.", u"During her more than fifty years of public service and civic activism, Midge did more than break down barriers. She established new patterns. History records her accomplishments as a series of firsts. She was the first woman elected to the Rochester City Council. She was the first woman with an office in the West Wing of the White House. She was one of the first women in politics to grace the cover of Newsweek. But being first wasn't what defined Midge; it was what she did once there that marked her legacy.", u"When President Carter gave her an office in the West Wing, Midge used it to be a ``window to the nation.'' She brought constituencies into the White House that had never been there before. She met with gay and lesbian leaders, the poor, and the disabled. She was particularly active in fighting for women's equality, advocating for issues including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and the protection of women's reproductive rights.", u"Midge championed women in politics, supporting female candidates at all levels and working to appoint more women to high office. When she worked in the White House, there were only eighteen women in the House of Representatives and two in the Senate. Today, seventy-six women serve in the House and seventeen serve in the Senate. As a prime example of her dry wit Midge once remarked on this subject, ``When we start electing and appointing mediocre women--then, and only then, we will achieve total equality with men.''", u'I attended some of the numerous trainings Midge conducted for women candidates of both parties. She coached us in the art of public speaking. She was a wonderful teacher who helped women develop confidence in their abilities. But she was more than a public speaker; she was a storyteller. She could captivate an audience with a story of her time in the Carter Administration, boasting that Mikhail Baryshnikov flirtatiously asked her to dance at a White House event, or she would show a photo of herself playfully sparring with Muhammad Ali.', u"Midge's gift for speaking was her ability to move her listeners. She could make an audience feel as strongly as she did about an issue, and charm them with the force of her convictions and the forcefulness of her words. And she could instantly move an audience from heartfelt passion to unbridled laughter.", u"I learned a great deal from Midge, and I was proud to have her as my guest at President Obama's inauguration. Part of her legacy is the fact that today, it is not just women working in the West Wing who make the cover of Newsweek, but women running for President who do as well.", u"Midge was fond of hearing people say to her, ``You've come a long way, baby.'' She would coyly reply, ``Gosh, have I come a long way. And I love being called baby.'' Because of Midge, our political system has come a long way, as well. Many of us in office today owe a debt of gratitude to Midge Costanza, our mentor and friend, because she was willing to go first.
