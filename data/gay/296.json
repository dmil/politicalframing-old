His passing is a tremendous loss for his family and all the citizens of Pasadena who knew this fine physician and civic leader.', u"``Dr. Ken,'' as he was known, graduated summa cum laude from Texas Christian University in 1952, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in 1955, and Bates School of Law, where he won the Fred Parks Award in 1977.", u"Dr. Mathis is best known for his radio show, KTRH's ``Ask the Doctor,'' which aired from the mid-80's to October of 1990. HIs kind and gentle manner was evident on and off the air in his counsel to his many patients. He was well-read and well-rounded and his colleagues noted his phenomenal ability to communicate with his patients. He was a popular guest speaker and often lectured nationwide on many medical and legal topics.", u'It was always clear that what mattered most to Dr. Ken Mathis was the well-being of his patients. In an era when the practice of medicine is rapidly changing, he reminded many of an old-fashioned country doctor. He was always available to patients who needed him and often opened his clinic on weekends. Patients could go to his clinic rather than endure the uncertainty of waiting or the trauma of the emergency room. His patients respected him for his compassion and capability and trusted him for his knowledge and expertise.', u'Dr. Mathis was deeply committed to his country and the City of Pasadena. He served as a qualified flight surgeon for the U.S. Air Force in France from 1957-1959 with the 50th TAC Wing F-100 Jet Fighter Bombers. His civic activities included service as a board member of the Southwest Diabetic Foundation and the American Heart Association, and he received the Paul Harris Award form the Pasadena Rotary Club. He traveled widely and spread the word about Pasadena wherever he went. His many interests included the Shriners, trains, classic cars, boats, and of course Dutch Masters cigars.', u"Whatever he did, Dr. Mathis' intelligence, compassion, and integrity served him and all those he encountered well. He brought a tireless energy, an unflagging drive, and a passionate caring to each of his endeavors.", u'Dr. Mathis was more than just a great physician; he was also a great Texan, a dedicated citizen, devoted husband, father and grandfather. We offer our sincere condolences to his wife Gay, his children and grandchildren, and his entire family. We feel their loss as our entire community mourns the passing of Dr. Kenneth Mathis.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/02/11/E147_honoring-dr-kenneth-gerhart-mathis-md/'}
