I am a cosponsor of this legislation because we must do all that we can to protect those who are injured because of their gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.", "Hate crimes can occur in any community--even one as wonderful and diverse as mine. On July 4, 1999--when we should have been celebrating the welcoming and embracing traditions of our great country, my district was rocked by the killing spree of the white supremacist, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. This madman left us grieving for Ricky Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University coach, a well-known community leader, a deeply religious man, a man who was committed to his family. His only crime was the color of his skin--he was African-American. Smith also murdered Won Joon Yoon, an Asian American student from Indiana.", "The bill we are considering today takes an important step toward making America a more just society, by closing a glaring loophole in our justice system that prevents the Federal Government from prosecuting cases where women, gay, transgender or disabled persons are victims of bias-motivated crimes for who they are. These crimes not only devastate victims and their family and friends, but they devastate the community to which the victim belongs by creating fear and intimidation. Hate crimes chip away at the very foundations of what it means to be an American--that all people are created equal and are afforded the same freedoms and protections.", "America must no longer ignore hate crimes of any kind. Everyone, regardless of race, sexual, orientation and gender identity, must be equal in the eyes of the law. The passage of H.R. 1913 will send the powerful message that America stands for tolerance and inclusion, and is opposed to prejudice in all its forms. I want to thank my good friend, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin, and the entire LGBT Equality Caucus for their tireless work to get this bill passed and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to H.R. 1913."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/04/30/E1035_local-law-enforcement-hate-crimes-prevention-act-o/"}
