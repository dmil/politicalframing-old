That means the person must do the following, first, prove that he or she is covered by ', u"Second, a person must show that he or she was qualified for the employment opportunity at issue and that the employer's adverse treatment was based on the person's sexual orientation.", u'Third, the employer must then present evidence to show that the adverse treatment was taken because of some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, not sexual orientation, and then the individual making the claim bears the ultimate burden of proving that discrimination based on sexual orientation actually occurred.', u'Now, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is not violated merely because an employment practice has a disparate impact on gay men and lesbian women. Therefore, statistics are not needed to enforce the Employment Nondiscrimination Act and employers are not required to ask whether an employee is gay. Despite this provision in the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, my colleagues are concerned that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will require employers to keep statistics regarding the sexual orientation of their employees.', u'The Employment Nondiscrimination Act grants the EEOC the same enforcement powers that it has under title VII. This enforcement structure parallels the ADA--under which employers do not have to ask if an employee has a disability or keep statistics--and the EEOC says that it will undoubtedly enforce ENDA in the same way that it enforces the ADA. Therefore, there will not be any additional reporting requirements.', u'Finally, the EEOC says that because ENDA does not recognize a cause of action for disparate impact discrimination, there are no requirements pursuant to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection. That has been an issue that has been brought up several times and raised again this evening. I hope I have responded to any of the concerns that people have on this issue, and I have included information from the EEOC in the record earlier today.', u'Second, Mr. President, this legislation is not a license for bizarre behavior--we heard that referenced earlier this evening. Like other civil rights laws, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act does not protect bizarre behavior. Employers can still enforce workplace rules as long as they apply them uniformly to heterosexuals and homosexuals. This legislation allows employers to discipline homosexuals and heterosexuals whose behavior is illegal or unsafe or that compromises their ability to perform their job--the examples given earlier this evening would clearly fall under those standards. These policies must simply be applied to all employees--heterosexual and homosexual.', u'For example, my colleagues expressed concern about dress conveying explicit sexual messages or that is otherwise inappropriate. There is no need for concern. An employer can enforce a dress code. It must simply apply to all employees. An employer may also enforce a code of conduct. School systems can discipline teachers who appear in pornographic movies or other kinds of activities, but they must discipline both homosexuals and heterosexuals similarly.', u'That is all we are looking for, similar treatment. Employers can establish codes of conduct. All they have to do is make sure that they apply to both groups.', u'I say to my colleagues who feel they do not understand this legislation, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is not a license to illegal behavior. It is legislation that allows homosexuals and heterosexuals to work without being the subject of discrimination. Once again, the legislation simply says that employees, whether heterosexual or homosexual, must be treated fairly and equally.', u'Finally, there is some question about where all of this would lead. I think we can look to the nine States that have laws at the present time. They can be the best answers to many of the questions posed by those opposed to the bill. We know, that these laws are not, and they have not been problematic. I have pointed out that in the 9 States, if you added all the cases together, over the period of the last 5 years, you would be lucky if there are 15 cases, in the last 4 to 5 years.', u'In fact, when the people of California faced a referendum in 1978 to exclude gay people from teaching or mentoring, that referendum was defeated with the help of Ronald Reagan, who did television spots in opposition. He understands, and I think most understand, that we should not be stereotyping individuals. But stereotypes have been used against gay men and lesbians in the past and in this debate, as well.', u'This is what former President Reagan said in 1978:', u"As to the role model argument, a woman writing to the editor of a Southern California newspaper said it all: ``If teachers had such power over children, I would have been a nun years ago.'' Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that a child's teachers do not really influence this.", u'Although I have not always agreed with former President Reagan, in this case, I think he is right on target, just as Senator Barry Goldwater.', u"This legislation deals with the unfair stereotypes. Homosexuals are not strangers, or pedophiles, or child molesters. They are people we know, respect, and care about. They are people of integrity. They have a sense of right and wrong, an understanding of justice and fair play, and a willingness to work hard. They are American citizens, and they don't deserve to be subjected to discrimination on the job.", u'We have fought against similar stereotypes regarding women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly, and religious believers.', u'In the past, we thought women were too weak to compete in the board room or on the playing field. Today, we celebrate their business acumen and gold medal-winning athletic achievements. In the past, people in this Chamber have questioned the intelligence and tenacity of minorities. We still fight some of those battles, but we are not where we used to be. In the past, the Nation questioned whether a Catholic should be President. I remember when our country pushed bigotry aside and put such a man in the White House.', u'We have become a better country because we rose above the discrimination that divides us and nurtures bigotry.', u'Mr. President, I yield the floor.', u'Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/09/09/S10068_employment-nondiscrimination-act/'}
