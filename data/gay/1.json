Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran, who will manage this bill today, will be here at 2 o'clock to present their opening statements. We hope Senators who have amendments will be in a position to offer those.", "Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the two managers of the bill, have suggested we have a cutoff time for the offering of amendments tomorrow. We will work toward that goal after conferring more with the two managers of the bill.", "Concerning this very important legislation, we need to move to it, as we will, and also move through it as quickly as we can.", "This week sometime we will also be able to deliberate on S. 625, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which is commonly referred to as the hate crimes bill. Senate consideration of this legislation is much needed and really long overdue. It demonstrates once again, I believe, the change that has taken place in this body since Senator Daschle took over as majority leader. We are moving this legislation for that fact alone. We would not be on this legislation but for the fact that Senator Daschle is the majority leader.", "The present law does not respond to hate crimes motivated by a person's gender, sexual orientation, or disability. In fact, one of these characteristics, sexual orientation, is the third leading motivation behind hate crimes.", "By now everyone has heard of some of the most egregious cases of hate crimes, national in scope. Happening just a few years ago, the one we still talk about is Matthew Shephard, a very small man in stature. He was a student at the University of Wyoming. He was gay. He was severely beaten and left for dead, simply because of his being gay.", "James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man, was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Texas. This man was walking home, simply walking on the street, when these evil people grabbed him, beat him, tied him to the back of a pickup, and dragged him through the streets while he was still alive.", "Unfortunately, these appalling tragedies were not isolated events. Incidents continue to be reported all over this country. Nevada is a small State population-wise--big in area--but even in the State of Nevada we have witnessed acts of hatred. A 20-year-old man from Las Vegas struck a Japanese-American girl in the head at a skinhead party. She just happened to be there. Someone set a black family's home on fire in Carson City and wrote the words ``White Power'' and other racial slurs at the scene. Vandals spray-painted a swastika and other graffiti on a Roman Catholic church in Henderson, NV. Three residents of Las Vegas burned a cross on the lawn of a black family's home. Two white men attacked two Muslim men with a baseball bat outside of a mosque in Sparks.", "Condemning these acts is important, but it is not enough. We must act with unbending resolve to legislate against them. These types of crimes not only infringe on the victims' rights, they erode people's sense of security and self-worth and confidence in our system.", "This country was founded on the principle that there should be liberty and justice for all. When perpetrators of hate crimes target anyone, they are really targeting against all of us and the principles upon which our diverse Nation was founded. We need those principles to continue to prevail."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/06/03/S4883-8_schedule/"}
