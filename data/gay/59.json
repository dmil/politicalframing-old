Did he go to a town meeting, as I have, and mention stem cell research without someone coming up to him--if they didn't volunteer during a meeting, maybe there is a little shyness--after the meeting and say: My daughter has juvenile diabetes? One lady told me she wakes her up twice during the night to test her blood. Another person comes to me and says: My mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. It has been going on for years. It is a burden on our family. Or into the congressional district now represented by Congressman Lane Evans, my closest friend in our delegation and a personal hero to me, a man suffering from Parkinson's disease who now has to withdraw from public life to fight this battle--aren't these the real-life stories of real-life people who are not reflected in the agenda nor in the priorities of the Republican-led Senate?"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/07/12/S7363-2_a-do-nothing-congress/"}
