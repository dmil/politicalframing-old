Present laws do not prohibit crimes against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender. Deputy Attorney General Holder urged Congress to pass legislation that would expand Federal authority to prosecute those responsible for such crimes.", "On May 3, 1999, I hosted a community discussion at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, on this timely and important piece of legislation, H.R. 1082, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999.", "The forum brought together scores of community leaders and organizations, including the National Conference for Community and Justice, the Human Rights Campaign, the Safe Homes Project, the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Center, and the Jewish Federation of Central Massachusetts.", "Over the past few months we as a country have witnessed horrific crimes motivated by hate. Last year James Byrd, Junior, a 49-year-old black man, was murdered in a brutal attack in Jasper, Texas. His alleged assailants, three white men, dragged him for 2 miles while he was chained to the back of a truck.", "Four months later Matthew Shepard, an openly gay student at the University of Wyoming, was kidnapped, robbed, beaten, and burned by two men on a cold October night. This young man, with a promising future, died 6 days later.", "Recently in Littleton, Colorado, certain high school students appeared to have been specifically targeted and murdered because of their race and chosen faith. In my own district, the Jewish Community Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, experienced the evils of anti-Semitism when Nazi swastikas were painted throughout the facilities.", "Those who participated in the community meeting last week shared moving accounts on the effects of intolerance. These crimes attack the very democratic foundation of our country.", "The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would expand the situations where the Department of Justice can prosecute defendants for violent crimes committed because of the victim's race, color, religion, or national origin.", "It would also authorize the Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Current Federal law does not cover crimes with these motives.", "In 1997, the latest year for which FBI figures are available, over 8,000 hate crime incidents were reported. That is nearly one hate crime every hour. Clearly the time to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act is now.", "Over 40 States have hate crimes statutes, including, I am proud to say, my home State of Massachusetts. However, only 21 cover sexual orientation, 22 cover gender, and 21 cover disability. By strengthening the Federal law, State and local authorities will be able to utilize Federal personnel and investigative resources.", "Hate knows no boundaries. We need a law to protect all Americans. Tough Federal hate crimes legislation would give our justice system the tools and authority to recognize acts of violence committed on the basis of a person's gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion.", "By recognizing these incidents and punishing those responsible, we can begin to eradicate these acts of hate from our schools, our neighborhoods, and our country.", "Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior, believed that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. By passing this legislation, Congress will send a clear and powerful message that we will not tolerate these violent acts which not only change the life of the victim, but affect the entire community. The ripple effect caused by these crimes sends shock waves throughout the targeted community, often leaving fear, despair, and loneliness in its wake.", "We all need to join together to break down the walls of ignorance and to build a community founded on tolerance, justice, and compassion. The allies of hate are not just the perpetrators. Silence and complacency are allies, as well. The enemy of hate is a community and a Congress that does not tolerate hateful messages, words, or deeds.", "We must take a stand and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 now; not next year or sometime in the future, but now."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/05/12/H3065-4_pass-the-hate-crimes-prevention-act/"}
