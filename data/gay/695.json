Williams, the commanding and strategic-minded Republican from Burkesville, has gradually established himself as the dominant personality in the legislature since taking the helm of the upper chamber six years ago. But during this year's session, which wrapped up last month, Williams played multiple starring roles. He was the deal maker--adding more money in the budget for the University of Kentucky and ensuring that one of Gov. Ernie Fletcher's priorities, the addition of two school days, was approved. He was a facilitator. Just when most everyone thought a seat-belt enforcement bill was dead, Williams tacked the measure--another key priority of Fletcher--on to less controversial legislation, which eventually passed. And early in the session, Democrats praised him for allowing bipartisan proposals relating to mine safety and a ban on protests at military funerals. He also was a lightning rod for criticism, notably the controversy over the University of the Cumberlands. It was Williams who inserted $10 million into the budget for construction of a pharmacy school on the campus of the Baptist-run university in Williamsburg, which is in his Senate district. Another $1 million would go to scholarships at the pharmacy school. The revelation about public funds going to a private university sparked some outcries, particularly after the school expelled a student for announcing on a Web site that he is gay. Williams has defended the funding. And an ongoing rhetorical feud between Williams and Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert provided an interesting sidebar to the legislature's work, as Williams sparked debates about separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches. Throughout the 60-day session, all roads seemed to lead through Williams. ``They led through me or over me?'' joked Williams, who at times comes off as affable and self-deprecating, and at others as defiant and argumentative. He acknowledged that he tried to approach 2006 differently than recent sessions that digressed into bickering and stalemate among the legislative leaders over key issues-- especially the budget. ``I felt like in the past, I had been drawn into a few confrontations that I shouldn't have gotten into. I don't think it was constructive to the institution,'' Williams said. That's not to say he remained above the fray. The last week of the session was a particularly grueling test of Williams' restraint. Lawmakers were trying to finalize details of the budget while scrambling to pass the last batch of other bills, including a proposal to lessen the tax burden on certain small businesses. As Williams attempted to ram through the Senate's version of that tax-relief plan, Democratic Sen. Tim Shaughnessy vehemently objected, at one point declaring: ``I don't trust you guys.'' So Williams switched off Shaughnessy's microphone. In the end, negotiations between Senate Republicans and House Democrats crumbled on the small-business tax issue--one of a handful of key priorities pegged by both parties that failed. But the main goal--passing the state's two-year, $18.1 billion spending plan--was achieved. And negotiations between House Democratic and Senate Republican leaders again proved to be a stage for Williams. For instance, House Democrats first included $17.5 million in their budget draft to repair a dam on the Kentucky River. The Senate stripped that funding in its version. During later closed-door negotiations between the two chambers' leaders, Williams was the first to emerge to tell reporters that they had restored the funds and allowed the Kentucky River Authority to use $33 million in additional fee money to fix more dams. Senate Republicans often gain the upper hand during such budget negotiations because Williams and Majority Floor Leader Dan Kelly of Springfield usually convey a united front, lawmakers say. Sen. Ernesto Scorsone, a Lexington Democrat, said that's because Williams ``controls the party caucus.'' But Williams noted that it's easier for Senate Republicans to get on the same page because there's just 21 of them, compared to 56 House Democrats. ``It would appear to me that the Democratic negotiators generally do not have a unified plan or plan of action. There are about five or six strong personalities,'' he said. ``They don't seem to come to a consensus before they come to the table.'' Others say that the Senate Republican leaders have a knack for putting their own stamp on just about every key bill. ``David and Sen. Kelly are the driving force behind all the legislation that comes out, no matter where it originates,'' said Rep. Stan Lee, a Lexington Republican. As a result, many legislators have dubbed Williams the most powerful man in Frankfort, with more effect than even the governor. ``David knows what he wants and goes out and gets it. I don't think the governor knows exactly what he wants, and certainly doesn't know how to get it,'' said Scorsone. ``Fletcher's future, in terms of legislative success, is very much in the hands of David Williams.'' The governor's staff disagreed, saying Fletcher has stood on his own. ``Governor Fletcher's record of accomplishments speaks for itself. His style is to build consensus and find areas of common ground with members of the assembly,'' said chief of staff Stan Cave in a statement. Williams, who has said he supports Fletcher's re-election bid in '07, is deferential, noting that Fletcher missed a month of the session battling complications from a gallstone and pancreatitis. ``It's hard to compare management styles,'' he said. ``Obviously the governor, because of his illness, was not around a lot at crucial times.'' Williams, meanwhile, rarely missed a cue at those critical points. ``I feel I had the most productive session I've ever had,'' he said."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/05/12/S4520-2_tribute-to-david-williams/'}
