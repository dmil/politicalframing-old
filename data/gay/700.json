Dr. Michael Allkins will retire this month from Bay de Noc Community College, an institution that owes him a debt of gratitude for his tireless work to maintain, improve and strengthen not only the college, but the surrounding community.", "Dr. Allkins was appointed president of Bay de Noc Community College (Bay) on August 1st of 1997. During his tenure, President Allkins accomplished much, ensuring that Bay remains one of the finest community colleges in the Nation. On July 1st of 2006, his time at Bay will come to an end as he and his wife Linda begin a much deserved retirement.", "During his administration, Dr. Allkins presided over the completion of the Joseph Heirman University Center, remodeled the Student Center, and improved the chemistry and water technology labs on the campus.", "Bay was the first college in Michigan to be awarded a Michigan Technical Education Center. This innovative statewide program ensures that community colleges provide training that is relevant to the needs of local employers. It is through Dr. Allkins' leadership that Bay, in Escanaba, Michigan, was able to open the very first such technical training center in the entire state.", "That accomplishment alone demonstrates that Dr. Allkins is a forward thinking leader with a strategy for Bay's future. However, Dr. Allkins' accomplishments span well beyond the Technical Education Center. For over 10 years, the staff and faculty of Bay de Noc had been working to expand the college by opening a campus in neighboring Dickinson County. Under the leadership of Dr. Allkins, the college finally succeeded in passing a millage to fund the expansion and better serve Bay's growing student body 55 miles away from the main campus. Dr. Allkins was instrumental in passing the millage and breaking ground for the new facility.", "Dr. Allkins also led Bay through a lengthy, 10-year reaccreditation effort. This reaccreditation required improving the curriculum in general education, reviewing and assessing individual programs and making technological improvements a priority. Dr. Allkins also bolstered programs at the college that recognized the achievements of students, faculty and alumni and formalized Bay's graduation ceremonies.", "As any president of an educational institution must be, Dr. Allkins was also an effective ambassador for Bay. He was known for working with the Michigan Community College Association and with legislators to lay a stable financial foundation for Bay. Rural community colleges often have to assert themselves to receive their fair share of funding and Dr. Allkins was an effective advocate for Bay, working to see equitable funding for Michigan community colleges.", "Dr. Allkins was also involved in a variety of volunteer organizations in Escanaba and Delta counties. He served on the boards of the Delta County Area Chamber of Commerce, the Economic Development Alliance, the Upper Peninsula Great Lakes Educational Technologies, the YMCA and the Saint Francis Hospital Advisory Committee. He is an active member of the Escanaba Rotary Club.", "Even prior to coming to Bay de Noc Community College, Dr. Allkins had already enjoyed a career dedicated to education. As Executive Vice President of Instruction and Student Services, Vice President for Academic Affairs, and Interim President at South West Community College in Mount Gay, West Virginia, Dr. Allkins made a number of important contributions to preserving and growing that institution.", "Mr. Speaker, Dr. Michael Allkins has clearly made education and rural education, in particular, the focus of his career. Bay de Noc Community College and its surrounding communities are better for having enjoyed his stewardship. Because of his leadership skills and the importance of Bay de Noc Community College to the region, all of the Upper Peninsula benefited from having Dr. Michael Allkins and his wife, Linda Hirvonen, as professional citizens in our region of the country.", "I ask the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in congratulating Dr. Michael Allkins on his retirement and in thanking him and Linda for their commitment to education and our communities."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/14/E1144_tribute-to-dr-michael-allkins/"}
