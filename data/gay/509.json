It was on May 26, 1937 that Walter Reuther, President of United Automobile Workers Local 174 and three fellow UAW organizers--Richard Frankensteen, J.J. Kennedy and Robert Kantor--organized what they hoped would be a peaceful distribution of union literature by the ladies' auxiliary of Local 174. At Reuther's request, several neutral observers were also present, including members of the clergy, reporters and photographers. At the suggestion of one of these photographers, they climbed the steps to an overpass leading to Gate No. 4, the primary entrance to the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge industrial complex.", "Within minutes, Ford's ``Servicemen'' attacked them brutally, eventually throwing them down the two flights of iron steps leading up to the overpass. Dozens of the union's members were injured and one member died as a result of his injuries.", "The Battle of the Overpass galvanized the organizing efforts among Ford employees, and the photographs taken that day brought national attention to not only the demands of working men and women, but also to the tactics employed by management to crush the early unions. It was a turning point for the labor movement. Ford had won the battle in the street, but ultimately lost in the minds of the public. In just a few short years, Ford officially recognized the UAW and signed its first contract with the union.", "The right to safe working conditions, the eight-hour workday, the weekend . . . these are things that the men and women at the Battle of the Overpass fought, bled and even risked their lives for--and we should never forget that. Today, labor unions continue to negotiate for livable wages, decent health benefits, and ways to improve the quality of products and services they provide. They are striving to achieve fairer treatment for workers of color, working women, workers with disabilities and gay and lesbian workers, both on the job and in society. They continue to champion support for a strong public education system, along with the right of all children to receive quality education and opportunities for learning throughout adulthood. Unions continue to be on the front lines of promoting democracy across the globe. It is right that we remember those that fought so hard for that first contract 65 years ago, and draw strength from their perseverance, so that 65 years from now our children will look back and see the great progress made by current generations."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/06/07/E996-3_65th-anniversary-of-the-battle-of-the-overpass/"}
