Founded in 1974 as Women Against Rape, the agency consisted of a phone number to call for emotional support. Today that crisis line operates 24 hours a day, and the organization has an official board, paid staff, and volunteers who last year donated over 10,000 hours.", "Over the past 33 years, UASA has greatly expanded the services offered to the people of Sonoma County. It provides extensive training on helping victims, including not only women and girls, but also men, children, and the families of victims. Staff and volunteers also accompany victims and their families for police reporting, court appearances, medical exams, or other personal situations.", "Prevention programs include outreach to elementary through high school youths, reaching approximately 6,000 young people every year, as well as parents and school personnel. Other efforts include bilingual outreach to Hispanic teens, teen peer education training, anti- racism curriculum which deals with violence against the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender community, and a unique men's program featuring men educating men. All services are offered at no cost.", "UASA also plays a key role in the county's pioneering SART--sexual assault response team--which unites law enforcement, mental health, legal, and advocacy programs to support victims and families. This collaborative project makes services easily accessible and minimizes the stress felt by victims. The agency is also working with the District Attorney's office to establish a county-wide Family Justice Center.", "Executive Director Gloria Young has provided visionary leadership in shepherding the agency through many of these transitions. In 2004, Gloria received the Outstanding Executive Director Award from the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault. She has post poned her scheduled retirement this year in order to remain at the helm during a time when some services are threatened by the closing of a major hospital.", "Madam Speaker, UASA's long-term mission is to eliminate all forms of sexual assault. I know that with its inspired leadership, dedicated staff, and committed volunteers United Against Sexual Assault of Sonoma County has brought our community a long way towards achieving this goal and will not be satisfied until they have reached it. I salute UASA on their anniversary and look forward to the day when their services are no longer needed."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/03/06/E466-2_tribute-to-uasa-of-sonoma-county/"}
