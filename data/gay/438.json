I support the Senate Amendment because I stand on the side of our military and all who have sacrificed for our freedom, and that is why I support the repeal of the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'', DADT, policy which, since 1993 has resulted in the discharge of over 13,000 American servicemen and women and cost our taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in wasted funds. DADT denies equality to thousands of our soldiers and dissuades thousands more from enlisting in the defense of our country.", u'I believe that all Americans willing to risk their lives in the defense of our country and obey its laws should be allowed to do so. Both our military and civilian leaders support the repeal of DADT. It is our responsibility to ensure that this change is initiated at a gradual, manageable pace so as to avoid any unnecessary disruption.', u"Defense Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, understand that an orderly transition is critical to minimizing disruption in the ranks, ensuring we maintain our strength level and not compromise national security. I applaud Secretary Gates' leadership and initiative, beginning with the landmark report he commissioned in March 2010 which included a survey of over 115,000 enlisted personnel and 44,000 military family members. In conjunction with this report, the Department of Defense prepared an implementation plan that will provide a smooth transition with minimal dislocation. The Pentagon stands ready to implement this plan, and I am proud that Congress is acting to move it forward.", u'In the 17 years since DADT was adopted, there has been a remarkable change in public opinion regarding the acceptance of gays and lesbians serving in the armed forces. This change has been so dramatic that the repeal of DADT no longer represents a subject of controversy for the large majority of Americans. Indeed, repealing DADT brings public policy in line with informed popular sentiment, which is nearly always a positive good.', u"The Pentagon's report documents one of the largest surveys of the attitudes of military personnel ever conducted. Its key finding is that the sexual orientation of their peers is not a matter of concern to most service members. Nearly 7 in 10, 69 percent, of respondents believed that they had already served with a gay or lesbian in their unit, and it did not undermine morale or military readiness. The report also finds that, if properly implemented, the repeal of DADT will have no adverse affect on unit cohesion or morale. These attitudes are in line with those of most Americans, who recognize that the military needs every patriotic, able-bodied recruit during a time of war.", u"Mr. Speaker, opponents of the measure still claim that repealing DADT is ``social engineering'' that will undermine morale and erode the fighting force of our nation's military. Their claim is refuted by the empirical study conducted by the Pentagon. It is also interesting to note that similar arguments were raised in opposition to racial integration and the enlistment of women in the armed services. The critics were wrong then and they are wrong now. The action we take today also brings us in line with the long-standing practice of our NATO allies as well as that of Israel, a nation rooted in faith that would do nothing to compromise the security of its people.", u'Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation and urge all my colleagues to do likewise. I look forward to the moment when President Obama signs this bill into law, which will at once strengthen our armed forces and ensure that all those who want to defend our freedom are given the opportunity.
