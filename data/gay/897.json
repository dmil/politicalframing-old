Fortunately, the son and the four other victims survived the shooting and are on their way to recovery. Unfortunately, within minutes of this tragic shooting, the Nation learned that the same assailant had murdered in cold blood U.S. Postal Service carrier Joseph Ileto, a Filipino American, on account of his race.', u'This episode is but one of a growing list of hate crimes targeting places once believed to be safe havens--including schools, synagogues, churches, community centers. This incident is a grim reminder of how hate can provoke violence against the young and innocent. Unless we address this hatred and violence in our communities immediately and unequivocally, the list of such horrific events will certainly grow.', u'We have before us legislation that would address this growing blight on our society: the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This important legislation was introduced by my colleague Senator Kennedy and adopted by the Senate as part of Fiscal Year 2000 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act.', u"Unfortunately, the measure was stripped from the first Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill presented to the President. I urge my colleagues to insist on this provision's inclusion in the next such bill.", u'This legislation is urgently needed to compensate for two limitations in the current law. First, even in the most blatant cases of racial, ethnic, or religious violence, no federal jurisdiction exists unless the victim was targeted while exercising one of six federally protected activities--attending a public school or college; participating in a service or program sponsored by a state or local government; applying for or engaging in employment; serving as juror in a state court; traveling or using a facility of interstate commerce; and enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public accommodation.', u'These limitations have led to acquittals in several of the cases in which the Department of Justice has determined a need to assert federal jurisdiction and has limited the ability of federal law enforcement officials to work with state and local officials in the investigation and prosecution of many incidents of brutal, hate-motivated violence.', u"A second limitation in current law is that it provides no coverage whatsoever for violent hate crimes committed because of bias based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. As a result, federal authorities cannot prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others based on these characteristics. This is especially disturbing given the fact that according to the FBI, crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals ranked third in reported hate crimes in 1998, registering 1,260 or 15.6 percent of all reported incidents. Unfortunately, there are those who would stop short of supporting this important legislation because it extends protections to those targeted on account of their sexual orientation.", u'The hate crimes legislation introduced this year would remedy would expand the legislation I authored in 1994, which provided a bifurcated trial and enhanced penalties for felonies spawned by hate that took place either on federal land or in pursuance of a federally protected right (such as voting or attending a public school).', u'The Hate Crimes Protection Act broadens federal jurisdiction to cover all violent crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred, regardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected right. It would also include sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of protected categories within current federal hate crime law, provided there is a sufficient connection with interstate commerce.', u'At the same time, federal involvement would only come into play if the Attorney General certifies that federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. In recent years, the existing federal hate crimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases where the state criminal justice system did not achieve a just result.', u'For many years I have been deeply concerned about hate crimes and the immeasurable impact they have on victims, their families and our communities. As I have previously mentioned, in 1993 I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act, which was signed into law in 1994 as a part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Today, I believe the Hate Crimes legislation will build on this effort by modifying the current laws to allow the federal government to provide the vital assistance to states in investigating of crimes of this magnitude.', u"Sadly, hate crimes are becoming too commonplace in America. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 1998, 7,775 hate crime incidents were reported in the United States and 9,722 victims. Of that total, 4,321 or 58 percent of the crimes were committed on account of the victim's race. More than 3,660 victims of anti-Black crimes; 1,003 victims of anti-White crimes, 620 victims of anti-Hispanic crimes; and 372 victims of anti-Asian/Pacific Islander crimes.", u'In that same year, 1,390 or roughly 16.0 percent of the victims were targeted because of their religious affiliation. The number of anti-Jewish incidents is second only to those against blacks and far exceeds offenses against all other religious groups combined. Moreover, while by most accounts anti-Semitism in America has declined dramatically over the years, the level of violence is escalating.', u'Civil rights groups as well as federal and State authorities agree that in the last five years, reported hate crimes have increased annually, from 5,932 in 1994 to 7,755 in 1998. As of 1998, four States still do not collect hate crime data. Yet, even if all States were reporting these incidents, it would be difficult to gauge the true extent of the hate crime problem in this country because bias-motivated crimes typically are under reported by both law enforcement agencies and victims.', u'And while these crimes have become more numerous, they have also become more violent. Monitoring groups have observed a shift from racially-motivated property crimes, such as spray painting, defacement and graffiti, to personal crimes such as assault, threat and harassment. On a national scale, according to FBI statistics, almost 7 out of 10 hate crimes are directed against people. Nonhate crimes, by contrast, are directed against people only 11 percent of the time.', u'This legislation is long overdue. Looking back on this year alone, one might recall the litany of news stories describing a murderous rampage at a school in Littleton, Colorado; or the drive-by shooting attacks on Jews, an African-American, and Asian-Americans in Chicago, Illinois; or the two pipe-bomb explosions at the predominantly African American Florida A&M University; the brutal murders of two gay men in California; or the torching of synagogues in California; all despicable acts of virulent hatred.', u'We should work to give our citizens protection from those who would do them harm simply based upon their race, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. Enactment of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act would send a message to our nation and the world that the singling out of an individual based on any of these characteristics will not go unnoticed or unpunished.', u'Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to enact this important legislation prior the end of this session.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/11/09/S14400_hate-crime-violence/'}
