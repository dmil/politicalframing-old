In and of themselves, these years are enough to qualify her for special recognition, but she also served as my Assistant for four years when I was a member of the San Diego Board of Education, as my Council Representative for five years when I was a member of the San Diego City Council, and in numerous roles in many of my campaigns, including Finance Director for two of my Congressional Campaigns. When one of my early campaigns showed practically a zero in donations for an entire summer month of fundraising, I called on her, and the contributors returned. Throughout the years, she has been my go-to person when I need something done and done right.", "Upon reflection, I believe that her most important contribution has been to provide a consistent and friendly voice to the people we are serving, knowing many by name. She gives them what they are asking for--either the answers they need or information about who can help if we are not the right office to call. A visitor or caller never goes away without assistance.", "Sharon's work over the years has included legislation that addresses people's needs: education, gay and lesbian, health, labor, Native American, senior citizen and Social Security, religion, art, welfare, women, and veterans issues. She was my sole staff person for the House of Representatives Veterans' Affairs Committee (VA) for fourteen years. She has met with constituents and lobbyists, answered mail, prepared my statements for the VA and the House and talking points for speaking engagements, prepared bills for introduction in the House, and written press releases. In fact, she has done almost everything in my office, from the duties of staff assistant to executive assistant to administrative assistant, as needed--just not systems administration.", "She has taken a keen interest in how microcredit and microenterprise can help many people in our country, travelling to Bangladesh to learn about the Grameen Bank in Dhaka, founded by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus.", "She has helped me prepare for many of the awards and recognitions I have received, for example, the 2009 Gusi Peace Prize I was recently awarded in the Philippines and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award I received from the National Education Association in 2003. Her supporting role in my work on the issues important to my Filipino constituents was critical to my selection as a recipient of the Legion of Honor, the highest civilian award given by the Philippines, presented by then-President Fidel Ramos.", "Sharon has also prepared the nominations I have made throughout the years for winning entries, for example in the Victory Against Hunger Award sponsored by the Congressional Hunger Center, the Private Sector Small Business Award from the Asian American Business Roundtable, the Congressional Angels in Adoption Awards from the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, the Ethics Award from the San Diego Human Dignity Foundation, and my nominations for the White House Conference on Aging. For each of the seventeen years we have been in Washington, she has been the DC staff person in charge of trip arrangements to Washington for the winning students in the annual Congressional Arts Competition. She has greeted our Congressional Pages and has handled the ticket requests for Presidential inaugurations.", "She has joined with me in many of our accomplishments. She was with me when we talked with VA Secretary Jesse Brown about the need for a Veterans' Home in Chula Vista, California. She was at the table when we spoke to VA Secretary Principi about providing medical equipment and supplies to the Veterans Hospital in Manila. She helped to bring a Community Based Outpatient Clinic to Imperial County, California and the Miramar National Cemetery to San Diego, California, with a groundbreaking scheduled for January 30, 2010.", "Her important legislative achievements include passage of several bills for veterans, including a bill to provide a posthumous Purple Heart to the families of every prisoner of war who died while in a prison camp, a bill to provide compensation to World War II Merchant Mariners who were excluded from the original GI Bill benefits, and legislation to restore equity and promised benefits to the Filipino World War II veterans who were deprived of both by an act of Congress in 1946.", "I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to Sharon for 26 years of working together, learning together, and achieving together. As a former history professor, I believe that we have changed a small piece of history."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/01/13/E23_in-tribute-to-sharon-schultze/"}
