Henry D. Connell. It was a heart-warming, emotional and unique experience. This funeral was particularly moving since Corporal Connell was only 17 years old when he died on the battlefield in the small village of Unsan in the Democratic Republic of Korea. It was here that his regiment fought with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for four long grueling days, and where he, and more than 1,000 members of the 8th Regiment, lost their lives.", u"It was November 2, 1950 when the United States Army declared Corporal Henry Connell to officially be missing in action. And 43 years later, on July 12, 1993, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea turned over the remains of 17 soldiers believed to be unaccounted for U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. Corporal Henry D. Connell's remains were one of the 17 soldiers recovered.", u'All told, this Springfield soldier was missing in action for 55 years. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, eager to serve in the Korean War, and served for only 8 months before he died, not living to see his 18th birthday. During his brief tenure in the army, he earned a Bronze Star and was promoted to corporal. Henry Connell was born in Springfield, MA and was the son of the late Robert F. Connell and Beatrice (Creamer) Connell Lanzillo. And this past Saturday, his remains were buried alongside his late mother in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery on Tinkham Road in Springfield.', u"Mr. Speaker, this was a unique and moving ceremony, and I feel fortunate to have been able to attend. I thank everyone involved who made this appropriate remembrance possible, and extend my sympathies to Thomas W. Connell, Henry's brother, and his wife Patricia and their family at this difficult, yet special time.", u'I would also like to enter into the Congressional Record the official obituary that recently ran in the Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper honoring the life of Corporal Henry D. Connell. May Henry Connell now rest in peace.', u"1933-1950 Springfield.--Henry D.
