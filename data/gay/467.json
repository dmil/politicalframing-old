During the last 20 years, Mr. Anthos repeatedly traveled by bus from Detroit to Lansing with a singular purpose, to urge the Michigan capital's dome be illuminated in red, white and blue, to honor his country.", "As he put it, he wanted Michigan to be ``the first State to inaugurate this patriotic tribute to its loyal citizens.'' He had support from many in the State, and had hoped for dedication lighting during Michigan Week, which will occur in May of this year, when Michigan would celebrate its 170th anniversary as our 26th State.", "On the evening of February 13, 2007, Mr. Anthos was riding a bus home from the Detroit Public Library. A passenger on the bus yelled at him and asked if he was gay. The man then followed him off the bus, where Mr. Anthos was helping a wheelchair bound friend off of the bus. The assailant then struck Anthos in the back with a metal pipe, leaving him critically injured, lying in the snow.", "The man left, without any effort to rob Mr. Anthos. This clearly was a hate crime, where Anthos was targeted because of his sexual orientation. Mr. Anthos tragically was left paralyzed from the neck down, before he slipped into a 10-day coma. He passed away on February 23, 2007. His killer has yet to be found.", "Unfortunately, Andrew Anthos has not been the only victim of a hate crime. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's latest statistics tell us that over 8,800 individuals were the victim of a hate crime in 2005. 4,900 of these crimes were racially motivated, while 1,200 were based on sexual orientation. Many of these crimes resulted in death or serious bodily harm.", "No one should be targeted because of the color of their skin, their religion, their gender or their sexual orientation. We have an obligation to make America a fully inclusive nation, a country that does not tolerate bias, discrimination or bigotry.", "Next week, as an original cosponsor, I will join Senators Kennedy and Smith in introducing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This bill will, for the first time, expand the definition of a hate crime to include gender, gender identity, disability, and sexual orientation. It will also allow the Federal Government to assist local law enforcement in investigation of hate crimes.", "We should condemn and act against the hate crimes that have plagued our Nation and have had such a devastating impact on Andrew Anthos, and thousands of others and their families. I hope the Senate will take swift action to enact the Kennedy-Smith bill.", "In addition, I hope that State governments will strengthen their own hate crime statutes to combat this growing trend. Andrew Anthos gave so much to our community, and it is essential that we give back to his memory by doing everything we can to reduce the incidence of these crimes."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/03/02/S2558-4_local-law-enforcement-hate-crimes-prevention-act/"}
