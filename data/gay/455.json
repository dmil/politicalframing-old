This amendment mirrors the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which I have been proud to cosponsor. This amendment puts America's values of equality and freedom into action.", u'Hate crimes are one of the most shocking types of violence against individuals. They are motivated by hatred and bigotry. But hate crimes target more than just one person--they are crimes against a community because of who they are--because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability. ', u"We are a nation that cherishes our freedom. All Americans must be free to go to church, walk through their communities, attend school without the fear that they will be the target of hate violence. We are nation that is built on a foundation of tolerance and equality. Yet no American can be free from discrimination and have true equality unless they are free from hate crimes. That is why hate crimes are so destructive. They tear at our Nation's greatest strength--our diversity.", u'This amendment does two things--it helps communities fight these crimes and it makes sure that those who are most often the target of hate motivated violence have the full protection of our Federal laws.', u'The amendment strengthens current law to help local law enforcement investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It does this by closing a loophole that prevented the Federal Government from assisting local and State police at any stage of the investigative process. Simply put--this bill authorizes Federal law enforcement officers to get involved if State or local governments want their help. That means local communities, which often have very limited resources for pursuing these types of crimes, will have the resources of the FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies at their disposal to help them more effectively prosecution incidents of hate violence.', u'This amendment also improves current law so it protects more Americans. It broadens the definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation and disability. Today, gay and lesbian Americans, women and those with disabilities are often targets of hate motivated violence, but existing Federal laws offer these communities no safeguards. That is the weakness in our current law. And that is what this legislation will fix. By passing this legislation today, the Senate says to all Americans that you deserve the full protection of the law and you deserve to be free from hate violence.', u'Hate crimes are crimes against more than one person--these crimes affect whole communities and create fear and terror in these communities and among all Americans. We need look no further than the horrific killings of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard to know the anger and grief that families and communities experience because of hatred and bigotry. Hate crimes attack the fundamental values of our Nation--freedom and equality. This bill is another step in the fight to make sure that in a nation that treasures these values these crimes do not occur.', u'So today I rise to support and urge my colleagues to pass this much needed and timely legislation. It is time that we put these American values into action and pass this hate crimes bill. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act says that all Americans are valued and protected--regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/07/16/S7591-2_national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year/'}
