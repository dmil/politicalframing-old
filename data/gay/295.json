This program targets single room occupancy hotels in New York City, serving over twenty five hundred participants and employing fifteen to twenty people. La Resurreccion has created an Immigration Clinic with the assistance of lawyers who provide their services free of charge to assist undocumented Immigrants with legal advice. La Resurreccion has also opened an after-school tutoring program called Creando Horizontes, designed and directed by educational professionals to target and enhance the reading and math skills children from the first to the eight grades.', u'Mr. Speaker, in collaboration with various community agencies, public officials and community leaders, La Resurreccion works to address the needs of our community. Among their prophetic ministries are: Educating and Empowering the Community, Advocating for Gay and Lesbian Rights, Advocating for the release of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, Advocating for Peace in Vieques, and Denouncing both Police Brutality and Anti-Immigration Laws. Presently, they are working with various agencies to create entrepreneurial opportunities for our young people.', u"It is a privilege for me to represent the 16th district of New York, where the new home of La Resurreccion United Methodist Church is located. I am delighted by the church's success. I have witnessed first-hand the exemplary work they are doing for our community and I am deeply impressed. I applaud the commitment and the efforts of La Resurreccion United Methodist Church's staff, under the leadership of Reverend Eddie Lopez, Jr., in the assistance they provide to our community, as well as in facilitating educational opportunities for our youth.", u'Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing La Resurreccion United Methodist Church and its staff and in wishing them continued success in their new building.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/10/16/E1800-2_tribute-to-la-resurreccion-united-methodist-church/'}
