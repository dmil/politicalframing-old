Kassing. Don will be retiring this year and I would like to highlight some of the significant contributions he has made, not only to the university, but also to the surrounding community. It is with mixed emotions that I say farewell to Don--I am saddened to see him go, but do so with tremendous pride and respect for the accomplishments he has made to my alma mater, San Jose State University.", u"In August of 2004, following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor, Don leapt into action as the newly appointed interim president of San Jose State University. Accepting this position just before the start of the school year, Don moved quickly to reassure an apprehensive campus that all focus would remain on the important business of starting the fall semester. His confidence in the collective capabilities of the San Jose State University faculty and staff, his generous and collegial management and leadership style, and the trust and respect that he had garnered during his 11 years of service as San Jose State University's vice president for administration and finance quickly created a sense of stability.", u"One of Don's first actions as president was to galvanize the campus to organize its first-ever campuswide strategic planning process. This thorough planning involved a mobilization of all campus units and resulted in a vibrant ``Vision 2010.'' San Jose State University is now at the end of two full cycles of implementation.", u'Leading by example, Don repeatedly made thoughtful, public stands on tough issues. He strongly supported a student initiative to honor two San Jose State athletes and civil rights icons, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, medal winners of the 1968 Olympics, who chose a non-violent protest during the medals ceremony to bring attention to the American civil rights movement. The groundbreaking and dedication ceremonies for the campus sculpture in 2007 gave the University at long last the opportunity to appropriately honor and embrace the athletes and their actions.', u'Building upon the successful partnership with the city of San Jose to develop the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, Don was instrumental in forging the Beyond Martin Luther King collaborative, which initiated a broader commitment and conversation with city and San Jose State University leadership staff and community stakeholders. Since 2004, key partnership projects have sparked neighborhood development, affordable housing-to-workforce enhancement and co-production of major events. This successful collaborative effort serves as a model of how a positive, symbiotic relationship between a lively campus and a vibrant downtown can be used to enhance the stature of both a city and its university.', u"This year, Don led the campus in a decision to suspend blood drives, citing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's lifetime blood donor deferral affecting gay men as being in violation of the university's nondiscrimination policy. The public stand taken by SJSU has re-ignited debate across the country about FDA's policy. It is my hope that the questions raised by Don's actions will lead to a thorough, thoughtful, and scientifically sound reexamination of FDA policy.", u"Mr. Kassing's successes can best be summoned up in the words of its accrediting body. In a letter last July, Western Association of Schools and Colleges Executive Director Ralph Wolff said: ``The Commission would like to extend its commendation to the San Jose State University community on the truly remarkable distance it has traveled since fall 2004. The team report notes `significant progress' in assessment of student learning and enrollment management; the positive influence of recent appointments at the senior level; an operational strategic plan; innovative new programs for student success; and above all, dramatic changes in culture, energy and focus on campus.''", u'Madam Speaker, I will miss seeing my friend, Don Kassing, in San Jose, but wish him and his spouse, Amy, only the best as they embark on the next phase of their journey in Arizona.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/05/14/E913-2_honoring-the-contributions-of-mr-don-w-kassing-pre/'}
