She lost a child, a son, in the horrible attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. But Rita Lazar remains a pacifist, dedicating her life to eradicating war all over the world. And she is brave. She wrote a letter to the New York Times, that in essence said that although she knew this country's response to 911 would be war, she and many others feel that the answer is peace. She asked, as many have asked, that this country not go to war, not in the name of her son. Not in the name of her child.", "All over the world, there is a movement afloat. People are coming together to say please, please, please, do not go to war--not in my name, and not in the name of my child.", "Not in My Name. Not in the Name of My Child. People are saying to governments . . . War? No, not in my name. Destruction? . . . No, not in my name. Weapons of Mass Destruction? No, not in my name. Pollution? No, not in my name.", "People from every walk of life--young and old, rich and poor, gay and straight, are saying: Not In My Name.", "There is an entire coalition of people who, though horribly saddened by the events at the World Trade Center, send out a mighty call for peace. The September 11 Families for A Peaceful Tomorrow have given us a powerful message--they want a world in which no one, no child, no son, no father, no husband, no wife, no mother, no loved one has to suffer the horror of losing a family member in the name of war. Their bravery is a reminder of our duty towards making the world in which we live one of peace. If you go to their website at peacefultomorrows.org, you will see a quote from Martin Luther King Jr., that says, ``Wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.'' These people, these brave and suffering souls, have lost sons and daughters and husbands and fathers and wives and mothers to the 911 attack, and yet, miraculously, they are saying, don't go to war, not in the name of our loved ones, Not in the Name of My Child.", "Among them are Phyllis and Orlando Rodriguez, who lost their only son Greg at the World Trade Center. The Rodriguez' also sent a letter to the media with the headline, ``Not in Our Son's Name.'' They pleaded for a peaceful solution to this conflict, and they are joined by thousands upon thousands of people all over the world, as witnessed by the huge rally in Washington, DC on April 20 2002, where an estimated two hundred thousand people called out for an end to war.", "And this cry is deepening, from a cry against war to a cry against injustice everywhere.", "People all over America are saying that they don't want American corporations stealing the resources of other countries and destroying the forested lands and waters of this country--not in their name.", "Israeli settlers have a peace group called Not in My Name. They are saying to the Israeli government, yes, we want a home, yes, we want a safe place to be, but not through violence and destruction and terror. They are saying to the Israeli government--don't take land from Palestinians, don't destroy their infrastructure, don't take their homes, don't destroy their family structures and their communities and their neighborhoods. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child.", "Why is this Not in My Name movement growing? Because when all is said and done, people all over the world, rich and poor, old and young, want to do what is right. Americans want to do what is right. People know it is wrong for destruction to occur in their name. Not in My Name. Not in the name of my child. It's like saying to a murderer--``Don't kill for me,'' It's saying to those who pollute our waters, Not in my Name. It's saying to those who destroy the economy of other countries--Not in my name, not in the name of my child.", "Americans are gathering the courage to just say no. We are saying no to addictive lifestyles, addictive consumerism. We are saying no to wars and corporate takeover and the IMF loans that gobble up people and their resources.", "And all over the world, people are saying, if you are committing these acts in my name, then don't. If you are committing these acts--waging war on the innocent, destroying the environment, buying bombs when babies need bottles . . . then don't do it for me. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child.", "Americans want peace, and justice and to live up to the conscience of its forbears. So we are joining people of good will around the world who say, Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child. Not in My Name, Not in the Name of My Child."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/06/14/E1061-5_not-in-my-name/"}
