McCarthy. Leo passed away in San Francisco on February 5, 2007 at the age of 76. He leaves behind a legacy of commitment to California.", "Leo was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1930. When he was 3, his family moved to San Francisco's Mission District. Leo served in the Korean war, in the intelligence unit of the Strategic Air Command. He studied history at the University of San Francisco, USF, before entering USF law school. Leo began his political career through work on various political campaigns during law school.", "Leo was first elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1963, when at the age of 33, he became the youngest supervisor in San Francisco history. One of his enduring legacies is the creation of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. He also protected San Francisco's precious open spaces. During this time, he was appointed by then Governor Edmund ``Pat'' Brown to the Commission on Aging, where he demonstrated his devotion to aging issues which continued throughout his career.", "He was elected to the California State Assembly in 1968 and became the powerful Speaker of the Assembly in 1974. He helped bring more openness and efficiency to the legislature. He also promoted gay rights and coastal protection.", "Leo served three terms as lieutenant governor from 1983-1995. As lieutenant Governor, he was active with the State Lands Commission and public education through the University of California. Lieutenant Governor McCarthy helped coordinate California's disaster relief efforts following the Loma Prieta earthquake. As a member of Congress, I was proud to work with Leo on this disaster relief effort. I am so pleased that our paths crossed many times over the years on so many important issues.", "Leo retired from politics in 1994. He helped establish the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at USF in 2002. The Center ``seeks to inspire and equip students for lives and careers of ethical public service and serving others.'' The Center speaks volumes about Leo's lifelong commitment to open government and public service.", "Leo McCarthy was a highly respected and beloved political leader in California. My heart goes out to Leo's family and friends. He will be missed by all who knew him. We take comfort in knowing that future generations will benefit from his spirit, his vision, and his leadership. He is survived by his wife Jackie; 4 children, Sharon, Conna, Adam and Niall; and his 11 grandchildren.
