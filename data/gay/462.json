Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. Section 305 would make an important change in our laws that is long overdue.', u'Under current law, foreign students, tourists, refugees and immigrants with HIV are prohibited from entering the United States. Section 305 would eliminate this HIV travel ban. I was pleased to join Senator Kerry and Senator Smith as an original cosponsor of the HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act, the original version of this provision.', u'Our immigration laws treat people with HIV differently than people with any other medical condition. HIV is the only disease specifically listed in U.S. law as a bar to entering the United States. For all other medical conditions, the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines whether the public health risk justifies a bar to admission.', u'Only 11 other countries have such harsh travel restrictions for people with HIV. Listen to the other countries with HIV travel bans: Armenia, Colombia, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sudan, and Yemen. Even China recently took steps to overturn its HIV travel ban. Does the United States really want to be in the company of Sudan when it comes to the treatment of people with HIV?', u'This HIV travel ban undermines our global leadership in the fight against AIDS and is incompatible with the goals of PEPFAR.', u'How can we tell other countries to end discrimination against people with HIV when we ourselves treat people with HIV who want to travel to our country differently than those with any other medical condition?', u"The travel ban for persons with HIV was enacted in 1993, at a time when there was fear and misunderstanding about this disease. The travel ban is a relic of an earlier time. Hasn't our knowledge about HIV and tolerance for people with HIV expanded enough in the 15 years to eliminate the travel ban?", u'The travel ban does not further any public health goals. Eliminating the ban will simply return the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to decide whether or not persons with HIV should be admitted into our country, as they do for all other diseases.', u'Our laws already require that anyone who wants to immigrate here demonstrate that they are unlikely to become an economic burden to the U.S. Government, which ensures that lifting the HIV travel ban would not have a significant financial cost.', u'Over 200 organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association and the World Health Organization, oppose the HIV travel ban. A broad range of faith-based groups, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, support lifting the HIV travel ban.', u"The HIV travel ban allows for a discretionary, case-by-case waiver process, but it is available only to a restricted group of visa applicants, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming. Let's take just one example: when Chicago hosted the Gay Games in 2006, the organizers had to work with various government agencies for several months before securing a waiver for persons with HIV to attend the event.", u'We will take an important step towards ending discrimination against people with HIV by lifting this travel ban and treating persons with HIV the same way we treat those with other medical conditions. That is consistent with the goals of PEPFAR and the U.S. leadership role in fighting discrimination against people with HIV around the world.', u'I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/07/16/S6820-2_tom-lantos-and-henry-j-hyde-united-states-global-l/'}
