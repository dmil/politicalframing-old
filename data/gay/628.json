It is essential for the Senate to deal with this important issue.', u"Hate crimes are modern day lynchings, and this is the time and the United States Senate is the place to take a stand against them. We must firmly and unequivocally say ``no'' to those who injure or murder because of hate. Every day that Congress fails to act, people across the Nation continue to be victimized by acts of bigotry based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability.", u'Hate crimes are a national disgrace and an attack on everything this country stands for. These crimes send a poisonous message that minorities are second class citizens with fewer rights. And, sadly, the number of hate crimes continues to rise.', u'70,000 hate crime offenses have been reported in the United States since 1991. In 1991 there were 4,500 hate crimes; 7,500 in 1993; 7,900 in 1995, and over 8,000 in 1997. There were 7,700 hate crimes reported in 1998, and although the numbers dropped slightly, the number and severity of offenses increased in the categories of religion, sexual orientation, and disability.', u'This is a serious and persistent problem--an epidemic that must be stopped.', u'All of us are aware of the most highly-publicized hate crimes, especially the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. But these two killings are just the tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have occurred this year:', u"On January 28 in Boston, a group of high school teenagers sexually assaulted and attacked a 16-year-old high school student on the subway because she was holding hands with another young girl, a common custom from her native African country. Thinking the victim was a lesbian, the group began groping the girl, ripping her clothes and pointing at their own genitals, while shouting ``Do you like this? Do you like this? Is this what you like?'' When the girl resisted, officials said, a teenage boy who was with the group pulled a knife on the girl, held it to her throat and threatened to slash her if she didn't obey her attackers. The girl was left unconscious from the beating. Three high school students were arrested in the attack and charged with civil rights violations, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, and indecent assault and battery.", u'On February 6 Tuscon, Arizona, a 20-year-old gay University of Arizona student was sitting at a cafe when a man came up behind him and punched and stabbed him with a large knife. Witnesses heard the perpetrator using vicious anti-gay epithets. The victim was treated at a local hospial and survived. The attack spurred an anti-hate rally on the campus a few days later, drawing over 1,000 people.', u"March 1 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, a black man was charged with a hate crime after going on a shooting rampage killing three white men and leaving two others critically wounded. Prior to the attack, he told a black woman that he wouldn't hurt her because he was ``out to get all white people.'' The perpetrator was shouting racial epithets at white maintenance workers, and shot only white men on his rampage. Authorities found anti-white and anti-Jewish writings in his home.", u"On April 29 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34, a white man was charged with murder and hate crimes in a shooting rampage targeting minorities that left five people dead and one critically wounded. The first victim was a Jewish neighbor who was shot half a dozen times before her house was set on fire. The perpetrator then went from shopping mall to shopping mall, shooting and killing two Asian Americans at a Chinese restaurant, an African American at a karate school, and a man from India at an Indian grocery. He also fired shots at two synagogues, and the word ``Jew'' and two swastikas were painted in red on one of the buildings. According to press reports, attorney of the accused is raising an insanity defense.", u"On June 4 in Rapid City, South Dakota, press reports indicate that police are baffled by a series of eight inexplicable drowning deaths among mostly Native Americans along Rapid Creek that have occurred over the course of 14 months. Law enforcement officials initially thought that the severely intoxicated men had drowned by accident. But local Native Americans believe an ``Indian-hater'' is waiting for the victims to become drunk and then dragging, rolling or pushing them into the water. These incidents come on the heels of a March 2000 report from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that shows that racial tensions in South Dakota are high, and that Native Americans in the state feel that the justice they received is unfair.", u'The most brutal and shocking hate crimes continue to make national headlines. Yet this list highlights just a few of the many hate crimes that afflict communities throughout the nation. This problem cannot and should not be ignored.', u'We know that hate groups have increased in number in recent years. A study by the Southern Poverty Law Center reported last year that 474 hate groups exist nationwide. Clearly, the Internet has given them a larger megaphone. In earlier years, hate groups would spread their messages of hate by using bulletin boards, newsletters, cable television, and occasional rallies. Now, the Internet gives them a vastly increased audience that can be reached with little effort. Hate sites have proliferated at distressing rates, and recruitment by hate groups has increased substantially. No minority is safe. African-Americans, Hispanics, Jews, gays, lesbians, Arab-Americans, Native Americans--all are targeted by these hate groups, which hide behind the first amendment as they spread their hateful messages. Unless we find better antidotes to the poison of high-tech hate, the problem of hate crimes in our free society will become increasingly severe.', u'The federal government has a special role in protecting civil rights and preventing discrimination. We need to take two major steps. We need to strengthen current federal laws against hate crimes based on race, religion or national origin. We also need to add gender, sexual orientation, and disability to the types of hate crimes where federal prosecution is available.', u"Our goal is to make the Justice Department a full partner with state and local governments in investigating and prosecuting these vicious crimes. We must find a way to act on this important issue and now is the time to do it. The silence of Congress on this basic issue has been deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't care--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that Congress continues to be A.W.O.L. in the national battle against hate crimes.", u"Recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the conscience of the country. It is clear that tolerance in America faces a serious challenge. We cannot hide behind the nation's record economic prosperity or its tremendous technological advances, when issues that go to the heart of the nation's founding ideals and basic values are at stake. When bigotry exists in America, we have to root it out.", u"Current federal laws are clearly inadequate. It's an embarrassment that we haven't already acted to close the glaring gaps. For too long, the federal government has been forced to fight hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. Federal participation in civil rights prosecutions in nothing new. In fact, it is Federalism 101. Federal involvement in the prosecution of racial bigotry dates back to the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. These fundamental civil rights laws were updated in the 1960's, but now they are no longer adequate to meet the current challenge. Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America, and action we propose is in the best tradition of responsible federal legislation.", u'Our amendment addresses two serious deficiencies in the principal federal hate crimes statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245, which currently applies to hate crimes committed on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin.', u"First, in these cases, the statutes requires the government to prove that the defendant committed an offense not only because of the victims race, color, religion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's participation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected activities'' listed in the statute. These activities are:", u'(1) Enrolling in or attending a public school or public college;', u'(2) Participating in a service or activity provided by a state or local government;', u'(3) Applying for employment or actually working;', u'(4) Service on a jury in a state or local court;', u'(5) Traveling in interstate commerce; or using a facility in interstate commerce; or', u'(6) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public accommodation.', u'In other words, even in these types of hate crimes, the prosecution must prove that in addition to the bigotry, the attack was also made because the victim was engaged in one of these six specific activities. Too often, federal prosecutions are not possible, because this additional burden of proof is too great.', u"Second, the federal statute provides no coverage at all for hate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. In the Matthew Shepard case in Wyoming, for example, no federal prosecution was possible because of this unacceptable gap in federal law.", u'Together, these limitations prevent the federal government from working with state and local law enforcement agencies in the investigation and prosecution of many of the most vicious hate crimes.', u'Our legislation adds new provisions to Title 18 to remedy each of these limitations.', u"In cases involving racial, religious, or ethnic violence, the amendment prohibits the intentional infliction of bodily injury, without regard to the victim's participation in one of the six ``federally protected activities.''", u"In cases involving hate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability, the amendment prohibits the intentional infliction of bodily injury whenever the act has a connection to interstate commerce.", u'In addition, when state and local officials request federal assistance, our amendment authorizes the federal government to lend its personnel and its technical resources to local officials, and to award grants of up to $100,000 to assist in the local investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. These provisions will permit the federal government to work in partnership with state and local officials in all aspects of the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.', u"This amendment has the support of the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and many organizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes, including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Anti-Defamation League, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force.", u'This hate crimes amendment is not a full answer, but it will send a strong signal from the President and Congress that violence against individuals because of their membership in certain groups will not be tolerated, and that the federal government will now be a full partner in meeting this threat in the years ahead. It is time to stop abdicating our federal responsibility and start doing more to win this all-important battle against hate crimes. If we fail, America is not America.', u'Mr. President, to review for the Senate quickly, this chart indicates the number of incidents, by bias motivation: Red being the race ethnicity and national origin, green being religion, blue being sexual orientation, and yellow being disability.', u'As you can see from these numbers, they have been virtually flat over the period of these last couple of years. We have seen the increased numbers that have taken place on the basis of sexual orientation and increased numbers with regard to disability. The fact is, in examining these cases, particularly in 1997 and 1998, we find that the incidence of violence has intensified dramatically and the viciousness in manifestations of hatred has increased significantly, reflecting itself in these acts of violence against individuals.', u'One of our great leaders in this cause was our former colleague, Paul Simon of Illinois, who was a strong advocate on this legislation many years ago. We settled at that time for just collecting information. Prior to a few years ago, we did not have accurate information. Now we have the accurate information and it cries out for action. There is no justification for delay, given that we have the information and we do know the cases that are taking place. We do not have to just rely on the various ad hoc cases that all of us read about, tragically almost every single day. We have accumulated these instances. We know from the direct testimony and comments from local law enforcement officials of the value and help and assistance that can be provided and that is needed in the prosecution of these cases.', u'I will take the time of the Senate on Monday to go through a greater description of exactly what we are doing and what we are not doing; the limitations that we have placed upon the prosecution. We will have a chance to review for the Senate what the other amendment, the Hatch amendment that will be before the Senate will do, what it will do and also what it will not do. We will have that opportunity on Tuesday next in the middle of the afternoon. It is imperative to take a vote on whether we are going to be serious here, with the Federal Government participating with States and local communities, trying to do something about the odious aspects of hate crimes.', u'Finally, as we know, these incidents of crime are not just acts against individuals. These acts really impact and affect a whole community because they are based on such bigotry and hatred and reflect that kind of hatred and viciousness, that the whole community is tainted by these kinds of activities. It cries out for appropriate involvement by the Federal Government to be a partner with local and State law enforcement officials. That is what this legislation does. Nothing more, nothing less. It is a partnership using the full force of the National Government to address these crimes.', u'My friend from Oregon is on the floor. He has been involved in this issue for a very long period of time. He has been indispensable as we have tried to move this legislation in the Senate. He has a long record in this area in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I value his counsel and strong support. It is a pleasure to see Senator Wyden on the floor to speak on this issue this morning.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/06/16/S5300_hate-crimes-prevention-act-amendment/'}
