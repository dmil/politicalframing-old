I want to thank my colleague, Maxine Waters for organizing tonight's special orders.", "Today, African American communities, including AIDS service organizations, city governments and people living with HIV/AIDS will acknowledge National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day through community events, vigils and by volunteering their services to organizations who provide HIV/AIDS services. These efforts will help raise awareness about the impact of HIV/AIDS in the African American community.", "In my district, the Alameda County Health Department, partners in the Alameda County State of Emergency Task Force and the faith community will also hold day long community events to mark this occasion.", "Three years ago the State of Emergency Task Force and the Alameda County Health Department helped to declare a Public Health Emergency on HIV/AIDS in the African American community. Since then, more resources have reached the community making an positive impact. In Alameda County, we are slowly seeing a decrease in new HIV infections. However, we must not slow our efforts to curb this deadly disease.", "Since the first AIDS diagnosis over 20 years ago, AIDS has devastated America's Black community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that for the first time in 8 years, HIV/AIDS case rates are rising in the United States. The CDC estimates 900,000 people living in the U.S. with HIV/AIDS, with approximately 40,000 new infections every year. African-Americans lead the number of these new infection rates. Blacks represent 12% of the Nation's population yet, they account for 47% of new AIDS cases.", "Since December 2000, over 130,000 AIDS cases were reported among women in the U.S. Almost \\2/3\\ of all women with AIDS are African American. And, girls make up 58% of new AIDS cases among teens in the U.S. Blacks are ten times more likely to be diagnosed with AIDS than whites and ten times more likely to die from the disease. The CDC also estimates that 30% of young, gay, black men are infected with the AIDS virus.", "Including the incidence of HIV/AIDS among African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans, racial minorities now represent a majority of new AIDS cases and a majority of Americans living with AIDS. It is imperative that National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day serve as a platform to educate people about the impact of HIV/AIDS on African-Americans and draw attention to the need for increased resources for the fight against this devastating disease.", "On World AIDS Day, President Bush promised to provide the necessary resources to combat the AIDS pandemic and ensure that people living with HIV and AIDS would receive effective care and treatment. It appears that the President only meant those words on World AIDS Day because these priority is not reflected in his budget. In fact domestic AIDS programs are flat funded despite the spike in new infection rates. We must remember that AIDS is also reaching far across our shores--in Africa, the motherland of many Black Americans, AIDS is decimating societies. HIV/AIDS is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time!", "So as we gather in the African-American community and in communities across the nation, together, we must work to increase the level of resource committed to fight this disease."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/02/07/E114-2_national-black-hivaids-awareness-day/"}
