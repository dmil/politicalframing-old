This year Capital Pride culminates with the Pride Parade on June 12th and a street fair on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the Capitol.', u'I have marched in the Pride parades since coming to Congress to emphasize the universality of human rights and the importance of enacting federal legislation to secure those rights for the GLBT community. Each year the Parade stops for a moment of silence to remember those who have died in the preceding year. That quiet will be particularly poignant as will remember local two women, who, in confronting injustice, were never silent: Wanda Alston and my frequent marching and running companion, Sister Maria, O.W., the Blue Nun.', u"This year's theme of ``Honor Our Past, Fight for Our Future'' holds special meaning for the citizens of the District of Columbia and its GLBT community in particular. Eleven years ago the District of Columbia lost the first vote it ever won on the floor of the House of Representatives, the delegate vote in the Committee of the Whole. The Republicans retracted the District's vote when they assumed control of the House. Our city of nearly 600,000 residents, who pay more taxes per capita than 49 of the 50 states, remains the only jurisdiction in the United States subject to Taxation Without Representation. Our Nation's Capital is entitled to that vote on the House floor now and to our birthright as American Citizens of full voting representation in Congress.", u"The joy of the Capital Pride Festival contrasts with the unhappy lot of GLBT soldiers who volunteer to protect our country with their lives, but must serve in silence and without the open support of their chosen families and communities, neither asking nor telling. The Armed Forces' homophobic policies, especially as they apply them to their own speakers of critical languages cannot continue to compromise our national security. Congress must pass The Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2005 this session."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/05/20/E1037-2_honoring-the-30th-annual-capital-pride-festival/'}
