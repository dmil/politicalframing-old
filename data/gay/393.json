Wes Pruden ranks at the top of all commentary writers.", "Some lies are so big they inevitably topple over, like the fat lady on a windy day at the beach. One of the biggest lies of recent times is the terrifying whopper, promulgated and promoted by the U.S. government, that anyone can get AIDS. The corollary of ``anyone,'' of course, is ``everyone.'' Maybe even Mother Teresa. Nobody has pushed this lie harder than the public-health officials appointed by Bill Clinton. Joycelyn Elders, the condomander-in-chief in the first years of the Clinton interrregnum, pushed it hardest of all. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has routinely and deliberately exaggerated the risks to heterosexuals because government officials who lobby Congress for federal research money think it's easier to get money for ``straights.'' Naturally the government's lobbyists insist that such chicanery is the furthest thing from noble bureaucratic minds. Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV, says it was only the ``trends,'' not something as gritty as politics, that ``guide the way we develop interventions.'' By ``interventions,'' the lady means strategies for scarfing up dollars. The CDC, under pressure from the politicians pandering to the lavender lobby, has been lying about AIDS for years. This newspaper, surveying a wide range of government researchers, reported in 1987, when the government scare offensive was first organized, that heterosexuals who lived ordinary lives--i.e., just about all of us--were at small risk of contracting AIDS. The exceptions were those who receive blood transfusions--such risk now is tiny, indeed--and who inject intravenous drugs with needles shared with the neighborhood hophead. We relied on CDC figures, suspect then as now, about who was getting AIDS. The CDC reports that as of Dec. 31, 1995, a total of 513,486 cases have been tabulated since June 1981. Of those, 51 percent are homosexual or bisexual males, 25 percent are druggies, and 8 percent are heterosexuals. This doesn't add up to 100 percent, and the rest are a mixture of men or women who live with druggies or either aren't sure or lie about who they are. The heterosexual percentage is thought to be inflated. CDC spokesmen, stung by the new publicity, conceded yesterday that the money spent on countering the AIDS ``epidemic'' had been spent in the wrong places, targeting the wrong people, and now it intends to funnel more AIDS money to those who need it most. ``We've got to make sure we follow the trends,'' said the spokesman, with a straight face, ``and at this time young gay men, minority gay men and [mostly minority] women who are partners of IV drug users are increasingly at risk.'' What the CDC won't say is that these are the people who always have been at risk. The Wall Street Journal concludes that, for most heterosexuals, the risk of AIDS is something less than the risk of getting hit by lightning. For children, whom the government frightens most of all, the risk is about that of getting hit by a meteor. But the government lie, that anyone/everyone catches it, certainly was effective. The media eager to promote the homosexual agenda, sensationalized the threat until soon nearly everyone imagined that Elizabeth Taylor would one day wear a little ribbon for all of us. Only last year, Redbook magazine ran a story titled, provocatively, ``Could I Have AIDS?'' The author, an obscure hysteric, concluded: ``My mind automatically telescopes to AIDS every time I get sick.'' John Ward, chief of AIDS tracking for the government, told the Wall Street Journal: ``I don't see much downside in slightly exaggerating the risk of AIDS.'' Well, the risk to him and his agency is that there's no reason now for any of us to believe anything he says. But it wasn't just the government. Many parents, despairing of instilling anything as quaint as moral values in their children, were eager to frighten their randy offspring into careful, if not moral, behavior. The homosexual lobby, despairing of legitimate reckless behavior and reckoning that the public regards them as being in deep doo-doo anyway, wanted to reduce the stigma of sexual practices most people regarded as repulsive. And certain moralists, with little human kindness in their hearts, insisted that God had just downloaded the e-mail message that AIDS was divine retribution. Some of them even seemed pleased. I once asked Joycelyn Elders, who eagerly lectured Americans that they should quit smoking because it's bad for their health even though it might feel good, whether she would be willing to tell homosexual lovers to knock off the anal intercourse because it's bad for their health even if feels good. She just changed the subject."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/05/10/E773-2_wes-pruden-on-the-aids-lobby/"}
