Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, our hearts also bear fresh bruises from the loss of a Senator and a former Senator.', u"Mr. President, on Saturday I traveled with several other Senators to Atlanta, GA, to attend the funeral of our late Senate colleague, Paul Coverdell. Senator Coverdell's departure from this life had been sudden. It had come without warning. Paul was only 61 and he could look forward to many fruitful years of service to the Nation and to his people. But it was not to be. The Scriptures tell us:", u'As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, So he flourishes. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.', u'On Wednesday of last week, I journeyed to Rhode Island with several other Senators to pay our last respects to a late departed former colleague, John O. Pastore, and to commiserate with his bereaved family and a great host of friends. We said the last goodbye to a man who had given much to the service of his country and who had retired from this body 26 years ago. A great throng paid homage to the remembrance of one whom they loved and who had served them so well, as was the case with our beloved late colleague, Paul Coverdell. There was a great throng, a large church filled to overflowing.', u'In both instances to which I have just referred, the choirs sang beautifully, the eulogies came forth from wounded hearts, the final farewells were spoken; then the crowds departed, and each person went on his or her own way to family hearth and home.', u"Over a long life of more than 80 years I have traveled this same journey many times. It is always the same. We travel the last mile with a departed friend and we come to the end of the way, when we can go no farther. That is as far as we can go. There we must part forever--insofar as this earthly life is concerned. From there, the loved one must go on alone, to ``The undiscovered country,'' as Shakespeare said, ``from whose bourne no traveler returns''.", u'So it is, and so it has been since the very beginning of our race, and so it will be in all the years to come. We are here today, and gone tomorrow. The clock of life is wound but once, And no man has the power to know just when the clock will strike, At late or early hour. Now is the only time you have, so live, love, work with a will; Put no faith in tomorrow for the clock may then be still.', u'Mr. President, John Pastore lived to be the ripe old age of 93; for Paul Coverdell, the grim reaper beckoned earlier, and the end came at 61. For those of us who remain on this side of the vale of trials and tears, the message from both of these lives is clear: be ready, be ready to go. William Cullen Bryant said it for you and for me:', u'All that breathes will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh when thou art gone, the solemn brood of care plod on, and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom; . . .', u"As one who has lived in this town of inflated egos for nearly half a century, I can testify that William Cullen Bryant had it right. I have seen the great, the near great, those who thought they were great, those who would never become great, and each incoming wave of life's sea surges forward on the sands of humanity's rocky coast, and then, just as quickly recedes into the vast emptiness of the past. But what cannot be washed away is the love and the memory of man's deeds and service to his fellowman.", u"So, each of us will carry within ourselves the memory of Senator Pastore's, Senator Coverdell's, Officer Chestnut's, and Detective Gibson's deeds and service to his fellow man. They have touched all of us, and we have been changed by them, because it was Tennyson who said, ``I am part of all that I have met.'' And so, in this small way, they live on in our hearts and in our dedication to do good with the hours and days that remain to us. The poet John Donne expressed it well, how each man's life--and each man's death--touches ours:", u"No man is an island, entire of itself; Every man is a piece of the continent, A part of the main; If a clod be washed away by the sea, [America] is the less, As well as if a promontory were, As well as if a manor of thy friend's Or of thine own were; Any man's death diminishes me, Because I am involved in mankind; And therefore Never send to know for whom the bell tolls: It tolls for thee.", u'Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/07/24/S7462_the-bell-tolls-for-thee/'}
