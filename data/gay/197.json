I commend Congressman Murphy and Leader Hoyer for their efforts on this legislation, and applaud Speaker Pelosi for bringing it to the floor. ", u"The ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy has been ill-conceived policy from the start--it is discriminatory on its face, and harmful to the gay and lesbian uniformed servicemembers that are forced to keep their sexual orientation from their friends, their coworkers, and their superior officers. Further, these military members are currently subject to discharge from the military if it is uncovered that they have participated in any activity that may be perceived to be associated with homosexuality.", u'Put simply, any policy that would go this far to discriminate against a particular group is just wrong. To date, thousands of brave servicemembers--including individuals who have risked their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq--have been discharged simply because of their sexual orientation.', u'In recent months, members of Congress have researched this issue in-depth--a Department of Defense survey was requested, and both the House and the Senate have held hearings on the issue. In a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing in February of this year, Defense Secretary Gates, and Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke out against the policy. Secretary Gates has remained steadfast in urging that Congress act to repeal this policy in an orderly manner.', u"Further evidence supporting repeal came on November 30th, when the results of a Department of Defense survey on ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' were released. The study showed that 70 percent--an overwhelming majority--of servicemembers believe that a repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell would be positive, mixed, or of no consequence.", u"Because Congress has been slow to act on this matter, the courts have become involved, and now stand to potentially declare ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' unconstitutional if we do not act. Secretary Gates has warned that judicial repeal will put an administrative burden on the Department of Defense, and has asserted that Congressional action is most favorable.", u"I believe that the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy poses an unnecessary threat to our national security and that the time has come for this policy to end.", u'I urge my fellow members of Congress to join me to repeal this harmful and discriminatory policy.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/E2177-3_dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-act-of-2010/'}
