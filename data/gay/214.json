According to FBI statistics, 118,000 hate crimes have been reported since 1991. During the same period of time, reported bias motivated crimes based on sexual orientation has more than tripled, yet the federal government currently has no jurisdiction to assist states and municipalities in dealing with even the most violent hate crimes against gay and lesbian Americans. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Reports showed that reported violent crimes based on sexual orientation constituted approximately one out of six hate crimes committed in 2007, with 1,265 reported for the year.", "The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 will provide assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies and amend federal law to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of violent, bias-motivated crimes. This important legislation is backed by a number of major law enforcement organizations, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, and the National Sheriffs Association.", "This bill will strengthen existing federal law by expanding its jurisdiction to provide protections for crimes directed at individuals because of their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability. The bill only applies to bias-motivated violent crimes and does not impinge public speech or writing.", "This bill includes an explicit First Amendment free speech protection. Pastors, Sunday school teachers, and religious leaders cannot be prosecuted for the content of their speech. Many religious groups have expressed support for the bill, including the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Interfaith Alliance, the Presbyterian Church, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, the United Methodist Church, and the Congress of National Black Churches.", "I am proud to support the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 because it is grounded in fundamental American values: recognizing the dignity of every person, protecting religious freedom, and freedom of speech. This legislation protects people from violence based on who they are, and has explicit protections to ensure that the law does not punish what people think, feel, or believe, but rather actions that physically harm others. I urge passage of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/05/06/E1072_local-law-enforcement-hate-crimes-prevention-act-o/"}
