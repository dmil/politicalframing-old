This morning the New York Times reported that with great alarm. It seemed that 850 men and women were discharged last year from the military for being homosexuals. They talk about an alarming increase in the number of people discharged under this policy that the Congress enacted just a couple of years ago.", "First of all, we should put this in perspective. The 850 discharged amounts to six one-hundredths of 1 percent of active duty military personnel, and I do not think anybody on that basis can claim there is some kind of vendetta or witch hunt or anything else going on. It is really important for us to stand back and review where we are today following the debate that we had on gays in the military in 1994.", "First, it is important to understand that the U.S. military maintains a commitment, a consistent commitment to the principle that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. This conviction has been one that was more thoroughly investigated and examined than perhaps any other policy, at least controversial policy, that this Senate body has examined in my memory and in many people's memories. We held exhaustive hearings. We held field hearings. We brought in experts from every perspective from the left, the right, and everywhere in between. Regardless of what their philosophical position was, we gave people the opportunity to express their opinion on this issue.", "The evidence and the findings of fact that are laid out in the law itself that this Congress passed by a very substantial margin and which was signed by the President clearly demonstrated a factual basis and a rational basis for the policy that was adopted. The conviction is justified and, I think, clearly won the support of an overwhelming majority of both the House and the Senate and reaffirmed and signed into law and now has been reaffirmed into law.", "Now, I know there are some who still disagree with the conclusion that the Senate arrived at and that the Congress arrived at, but they presented their argument in a national debate. That argument did not prevail and did not come close to prevailing. They lost that argument because we were able to demonstrate, on a bipartisan basis, led by Senator Nunn and was something I participated in and many others, that clear, open homosexuality undermines unit cohesion and military effectiveness. It creates an unavoidable sexual tension, often in close quarters, which compromises the central purpose of the military, and that is to be effectively prepared to be able to fight and win wars if necessary or if called on.", "Second, the U.S. military defines homosexuality as it has always defined homosexuality. First, making a statement that you are a homosexual is a presumption, is a clear indication, that you have adopted a homosexual lifestyle and is grounds for discharge. Second, engaging in a homosexual act is prima facie evidence of the case that you are a homosexual as defined in the law. Third, entering into a homosexual marriage. Those are the criteria.", "In the public debate, people have tried to call this policy many different things, but in fact it is the policy the military held even before we passed the so-called don't ask, don't tell policy in 1994, and it is the policy we enforce today. So when military commanders implement this policy, they are not violating the rules. They are simply enforcing the law as we in the Congress wrote the law, supported the law, voted for the law, on a bipartisan basis, and as that law was accepted and signed into law by the President, the current President, of the United States."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/02/26/S1653_homosexuality-in-the-military/"}
