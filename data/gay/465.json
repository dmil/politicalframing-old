AIDS Awareness month provides an opportunity to focus on the fact that HIV/AIDS is a formidable problem across the country. The 2008 AIDS Awareness Month occurs at a time when we have learned that we are struggling in the fight against AIDS. In early August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, released new statistics showing a 40 percent increase over previous estimates of new cases of HIV. The report found that that 53 percent of new HIV infections in 2006 were among gay and bisexual men, with almost one-third, 31 percent of new infections being among heterosexuals, which previous studies have shown have the greatest effect on African American women.", "HIV/AIDS is a public health problem in our country and an emergency situation within the African American community. African Americans make up 13 percent of the United States population, but they account for 49 percent of the estimated AIDS cases diagnosed since the epidemic began. Since the beginning of the epidemic, African Americans have accounted for 42 percent of the estimated 950,000 AIDS cases diagnosed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Not only are African Americans more likely to get AIDS, they are more likely to die from it, with more than half of all AIDS-related deaths being among African Americans. The statistics in Illinois resemble those nationally. African Americans aged 13-24 have the highest average annual HIV rates. African American males aged 13-24 had an average annual HIV rate was 2.5 times higher than the rate in White males, and almost 4 times higher than the rate in Hispanic men. In Chicago, African American women represent 75 percent of all women living with HIV/AIDS, yet they account for only 37 percent of the general female population aged 13 and over. This disparity is unacceptable. HIV / AIDS is plaguing and destroying African American communities, robbing our community of its fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters.", "We must do more to address this problem. We must increase funding for both prevention and treatment. We cannot rely on the failed policies of this administration to ignore strategies proven to decrease risky behavior and lower transmission rates and embrace strategies that do nothing. We must emphasize prevention, not restrict the CDC's prevention budget by 19 percent. We must support the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative and expand Ryan White. This is a public health. problem that mandates a comprehensive, intensive public health strategic response. I commend the City of Chicago's Department of Public Health, the State of Illinois Department of Public Health, and all of the organizations who actively are working to put at least a dent in this problem. I try to do my part to focus attention on this public health problem. A few weeks ago, I chaired an AIDS walk in Chicago that raised money for awareness and the fight for the cure. I also helped launch the ``Quality of Life'' Illinois Lottery game called Red Ribbon Cash. Proceeds gathered from the game will fund grants to public and private entities with HIV/AIDS prevention programs in Illinois. In terms of promoting prevention, I myself, have been publicly tested multiple times to convince the African-American community of the importance of being tested. America has within it the resources to address this issue; our political leadership must take action to do so. My fellow colleagues and I and all Americans need to do much more about this problem."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/09/27/E2079-3_in-recognition-of-aids-awareness-history-month/"}
