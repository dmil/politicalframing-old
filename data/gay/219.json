Every March we celebrate Women's History Month in recognition of the contributions and the sacrifices made by our Nation's women. Accordingly, it is my privilege to highlight Ms. Paonessa as a woman whose extraordinary efforts are vital to my district.", "Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and raised in San Diego, Elaine briefly attended San Diego State College before leaving to tour nationally with an all-girl orchestra as a trumpet player and a professional singer. Her musical background would return one day in her outreach efforts.", "Before she emerged as one of the Burbank community's brightest stars, Elaine relocated to Burbank with her husband, Bill, in 1952. There they raised their daughter, Gay, and their son, Guy, and were together until Bill's passing in 2006. It was during her 15 years as a homemaker that Elaine first amassed an impressive roster of volunteer commitments.", "As she worked with the Boy Scouts, led the Emblem Club of Burbank as president, chaired the city's Women's Council, founded the local Performing Arts Federation, and supported St. Joseph's Medical Center, Elaine established the blueprint of a truly devoted citizen. When she returned to work in 1967, Elaine blazed professional trails as the first female sales representative for the Automobile Club of Southern California. Never one to shy from community involvement, she served on the Burbank Chamber of Commerce board of directors and the Salvation Army advisory board.", "Today Elaine has not slowed a bit. She continues to lead and volunteer with several community organizations, including the Burbank Farmer's Market and the Burbank Civitan Club, to name just a few. Elaine revisits her roots as a traveling performer as the Musical Director of the Van Bloem Singers, a group that visits and performs at senior residences and healthcare facilities. For her incredible breadth of service, Elaine has been recognized by Los Angeles County Commission on Aging and has been honored with the President's Volunteer Service Award.", "With no charitable stone left unturned, Elaine's selfless and awe-inspiring dedication to the Burbank community is an invaluable addition to the legacy of Women's History Month. With gratitude and admiration, I ask all Members of Congress to join me today in honoring an extraordinary woman of California's 29th Congressional District, Ms. Elaine Paonessa."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/04/04/E523-4_a-tribute-to-elaine-paonessa/"}
