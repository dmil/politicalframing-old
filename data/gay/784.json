He will be succeeded by Pamela Brooks Gann, currently Dean of Duke University School of Law.", "For thirty years, the world of higher education has been roiled by change. The free speech movement of the 1960's, the first challenge to campus authority, was succeeded by demands for black and other ethnic studies, by the anti-war movement, by sit-ins and violent demonstrations against ROTC. Then came contests over affirmative action in admission and faculty hiring, the challenge to courses in Western Civilization, ``Gay Rights,'' and the passions aroused by ``political correctness.'' Throughout this turmoil, Claremont McKenna College, unlike so many other academic institutions, has held firmly to its founding mission--and it has prospered mightily.", "Jack Stark kept CMC on course through these stressful years, built its endowment, raised admission standards, and recruited distinguished faculty. If this were the sum of Jack Stark's achievement, we would honor him as one of the nation's great academic leaders. It is not only as a conservator, however, but also as an educational innovator that he deserves our attention.", "Jack Stark built on the campus of CMC--a small, private, undergraduate liberal arts college--nine research institutes, each different in its scholarly focus, but each contributing to the education of CMC's one thousand students.", "The first to be founded was The Henry Salvatori Center for the Study of Individual Freedom in the Modern World. The Salvatori Center supports the study of the conditions essential to the preservation of liberty, and under its directors, Ward Elliott, Ralph Rossum and Charles Kesler, has contributed vigorously to intellectual debate.", "The Rose Institute of State and Local Government, which was founded 25 years ago this April, specializes in survey research, fiscal analysis, and database development. The Institute authors studies of political and demographic trends, and its student team is trained in many aspects of computer-aided research. Its Board Chairman, Al Lunsford, refers to it as an ``unmatched resource of data and analysis in its geographical area of focus,'' and under its long-time director, Dr. Alan Heslop, the Institute has built a formidable reputation.", "The third to be founded was The Institute of Decision Science, which provides practical experience in economic and mathematical modeling, decision-making, and risk analysis for industry, government and the professions. It sponsors research and presents conferences on topics in decision science. IDS and its director, Janet Myhre, are frequently consulted by government agencies and major industrial corporations.", "Next to be founded was The Lowe Institute of Political Economy. Initially under the direction of Dr. Craig Stubblebine, now headed by Dr. Sven Arndt, the Lowe Institute supports the study of major issues in economic policy. Recent work has focused on the North American Free Trade Agreement, APEC and on trade and regulatory policies.", "The Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies was founded to support the study of critical issues in world affairs by sponsoring lectures, fellowships, visiting scholars, conferences, publications, and student internships. Its director, Dr. C. J. Lee, is an expert on Asia and has led the center in studies on Korean affairs.", "The Family of Benjamin Z. Gould Center of Humanistic Studies, originally headed by Dr. Ricardo Quinones, now by Dr. Jay Martin, is dedicated to understanding vital issues of the modern world in light of the perennial values provided by literature, philosophy, and religion. Towards this end, it sponsors publications, visiting speakers, student and faculty research, and organized lecture series.", "The Roberts Environmental Center uses an interdisciplinary approach encompassing biology, chemistry, economics, and political science to analyze environmental problems and to evaluate policy alternatives. Under its founding director, the late Robert Felmeth, and now under Dr. Emil Morhardt, it conducts field research, trains students in the use of analytical software and sponsors the Environment, Economics, and Politics major.", "The Kravis Leadership Institute provides for the academic study of leadership and sponsors speakers, mentoring, internships, and the Leadership Studies Sequence. Its director, Dr. Ronald Riggio, has been one of the pioneers of leadership studies in psychology.", "Most recent is the newly formed Berger Institute on Work, Family, and Children--the ninth of the institutes to be fathered by Jack Stark.", "At their best, these nine CMC research institutes provide students and faculty with opportunities to engage together in the investigation of key public policy issues. Students get close, hands-on experience of the challenges--the chores as well as the joys--of scholarship. Typically, their work is not for academic credit: the students are paid, and as their responsibilities increase so does their remuneration.", "Research on important subjects, produced by small faculty-student teams, funded by outside grants and contracts, is achieving a solid reputation for CMC's institutes. CMC students are making important extra-curricular gains by working with faculty specialists in methodologies they are sure to encounter in their later careers and on the important subjects that face our society. Every one of those CMC students owes Jack Stark a debt of gratitude. The world of higher education, too, would be wise to note this pioneering achievement at Claremont McKenna College."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/03/25/E568-2_honoring-jack-stark-upon-his-retirement/"}
