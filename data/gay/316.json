I totally disagree with this analysis. Granted, there is a section in ENDA that says no quotas, but also if you read the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to read the bill, if you look at section 11(A)(1), it grants to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the same powers with respect to sexual orientation it now has with respect to race, religion and sex.", "Under current law, employers are required to make, keep, and preserve records on their employment practices and to make reports to EEOC. That is under the United States Code 42, section 2000 e-8c. I read that code last Friday when we had the debate.", "I am amused, or interested, when people say, ``Well, that's just not factual. Employers, you won't have to do that.''", "I am reading section 11(A) of the bill that says the EEOC has the same authority as currently under the Civil Rights Acts to require such records. So the net result is employers are going to have to find out what people's sexual orientation is. They are going to have to ask questions they never asked before that employers don't want to ask and employees don't want to be asked. They are going to have to ask those kinds of questions.", "Plus, people said, ``It is not really required. Disparate impact is not allowed to be considered under this bill. We're not going to allow disparate impact to be used.'' Well, how is an employer to defend himself or herself? If they are sued under the legislation--and sponsors of this bill do not deny they have the right to sue for punitive and compensatory damages--how is an employer able to prove they have not discriminated? They have to show they have employed homosexuals and bisexuals. How do they show that? They have to ask questions. That is their defense. It is the same defense employers have as far as race, as far as sex, as far as disability or age.", "They have to be able to show that is not their practice, they have not discriminated; therefore, they have employed people of whatever sexual orientation. So, for that defense, they are going to have to ask people, they are going to have to ask questions: ``What is your sexual orientation? Are you homosexual, are you bisexual, are you heterosexual,'' in order to defend themselves.", "Maybe some people don't agree with that, but I don't see any other way. So the net result of this legislation will require employers to ask questions about sexual orientation which are not desired by employees or by employers.", "Plus, Mr. President, I have heard people imply, ``Wait a minute, this is not a whole lot different than what several people in the Senate have signed on to, a statement put out by the Human Rights Campaign Fund which says: ``Sexual orientation is not a consideration in the hiring, promoting or terminating of employees in my office.'' And 66 Members of the Senate have signed this statement.", "I did not sign that statement, but I guess I could have, because it has never been a consideration in my office. I never asked anybody, I do not want to ask anybody what their sexual orientation is. I didn't sign it because I thought, well, what if a person who is leading a gay activist cause--and there are individuals like that and some are in Congress, and other people--if somebody who had a known propensity to be a very strong advocate of gay rights, I guess, if they came and asked for a job in my office, I don't think they would be compatible and, therefore, I wouldn't hire them. So I didn't sign that pledge. But I can see why Senators would. Basically, I could sign it. It has never, ever been any consideration in any of my employment decisions as a Senator or when I ran a manufacturing company in Oklahoma.", "But some people could interpret this language as the same as ``don't ask, don't tell.'' If you don't ask, they can't tell. It is not a consideration, so no big deal. But that is not what is underlying Senator Kennedy's bill.", "Under the bill that we have before us, ENDA would make it law of the land, ENDA would elevate sexual orientation to a protected class under the Civil Rights Act. What it would do is say if the school board, for example, did not want to hire a person who was openly homosexual or a gay activist and have that person be a teacher or a coach or physical education instructor, if they felt like that was an inappropriate type person to have as a role model, they are in trouble under this legislation because that school could be sued. That school board might want to take disciplinary action or might not want to employ a person who had that orientation as a role model or mentor to a grade school class.", "So they might say, ``We don't want to make that decision,'' and, frankly, they could be sued under this legislation.", "Recently, there was a case in West Virginia where a principal was found dressing in drag and actually soliciting sexual favors in West Virginia. It just happened a couple of days ago. Because the principal asked for money, it was in violation of the State's prostitution act and, therefore, illegal. But if he had not asked for money, you could have a person who would be cross-dressing and soliciting sex--and that might be their sexual orientation--and the school board could not take disciplinary action because of their sexual orientation if it is kept private. My point being, you could have a lot of repercussions that go beyond what individuals have thought about in this legislation.", "This legislation is not ``don't ask, don't tell.'' I look at this statement that many Senators signed. I think a lot of people thought, ``Hey, don't ask, don't tell. That's my policy. I'll stick by it.'' That is not what we will ask if this proposed bill became law. ENDA would elevate sexual orientation to a much higher level, giving Federal protection and sanction, almost a Federal acceptance to promiscuity.", "You might say, how would that be? The legislation says you cannot discriminate on account of someone's sexual orientation as defined by ``homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual.'' It does not say by individual conduct that is done in monogamous relationships in private. So you might have a homosexual or heterosexual that is very promiscuous, with lots and lots of partners, and a company or an individual or an organization, maybe with somewhat of a religious orientation or moral commitment, finds that behavior very repulsive. If such individual or organization did not want to hire such a person or continue their employment, they would find themselves subject to suit. If ENDA passes, the Federal Government will say: Wait a minute. You can't make any distinctions no matter what your religious beliefs are. You can't make any distinction on account of a person's sexual orientation.", "``Bisexual'' by definition means promiscuous, having relations with both male and female. We are going to give that a Federal preferred protected status under this legislation. I think that is a serious mistake. What about that school board in West Virginia? What about a school board in Montana? What about a school board making decisions like this in Alabama where maybe this small community says we do not think we should have avowed open homosexual leaders, gay activists, as teachers in the fifth grade?", "Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/09/09/S10066_employment-nondiscrimination-act/"}
