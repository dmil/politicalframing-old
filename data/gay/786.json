It was the first conference held by the White House on mental health and mental health issues.', u"I had the pleasure of cochairing the children's mental health segment, and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that we have opened a new day. I was very pleased to have with me Dr. Schnee from Harris County, Judge Eric Andell and Gerald Womack. Dr. Schnee and Gerald Womack were representing the MHMRA, Mental Health and Mental Retardation Agency for the County of Harris.", u'It is very interesting to note that crises bring about ideas and collaboration. I would hope that that was not the case, but I think the fact that we have been given the opportunity now to seize this moment, that we should begin to fight mental health issues in a way that we provide more resources, more insight and action.', u'In our session we found many interesting points that were made, and I would like to share some of those with you. One, we need to collaborate more, from the Department of Education, to Health and Human Resources, to the Department of Justice, but as well we need to collaborate with local and State government. All of us need to be concerned about providing more mental health services and more services to the American public.', u'We must fight against stigma. We must ensure in particular that our children who have been receiving special education do find that special education, albeit it is a very good program, it is not the only way out, that our children can have access to the needed mental health services that they may need to have.', u'We heard from Sue, an adoptive parent, who had 22 children. She asked us, do not leave out the parent. Provide the kind of holistic approach where parents can be included, so that children who are troubled with behavioral problems will be able to have a supportive home system.', u'We have found that 60 percent of the teenagers in juvenile detention have behavioral, mental or emotional problems. We are finding a large number of our teenagers have attempted suicide or committed suicide. This is particularly prevalent in all of our various racial and ethnic groups, and particularly in groups that, we were told, are immigrant groups, like the Pacific Asian population who are facing deportation. If, as a juvenile, they have committed some grievance and wind up being taken to a juvenile center, they have the potential now under the 1996 immigration law to be deported.', u'We are finding in youth who are gay and lesbian that they are being attacked as being different, and therefore have a high degree of suicide. No group should be left out, no group should be stigmatized.', u"We also determined that there are not enough child psychiatrists in our Nation. One community, one large county, had one half-time child psychiatrist. When they were referring children to get services, they went to the county and were told, ``We can only take care of children ages 5 to 9. We do not have any services for children under 5 years old.'' It is well-known in the study of the brain that there is a great impact on babies, 0 to 3, and in fact that the fact that we have an ability to diagnose mental illness now and to do so by determining the brain's illnesses, if you will, so that we should not leave anyone out.", u"We also have found out unfortunately that with HMOs we have had less care as it relates to mental illness. There has not been a continuum of care. If a pediatrician sees a child that is troubled and refers that child to a psychologist or psychiatrist for help, with the parents' consent, the HMO willy-nilly may decide to change and not allow the continuum of care, and therefore that child breaks the cycle of care with that psychiatrist, which tells me that it is now time to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is now time to ensure that there is a continuum of care and to realize that HMOs must serve us and we not serve them.", u'A parent from Indiana said we must stop forcing parents to hit their heads against a brick wall, to provide services for them that they can reach out to, that they can get to. It is all right to say take your child over here across town and you cannot get a bus or train or cannot get the resources to get them to that.', u'Then we must realize that the resources that parents have, that people of all economic levels have, must be consistent, so that Medicaid goes only to the cardiocare. So if you are a parent and you are a cardholder and have Medicaid, you may not be able to provide the kind of care you need for your child, or vice versa.', u'It is important that we talk to HCFA and others so that the continuing of funding sources will be provided.', u'Mr. Speaker, let me say that this was an eye-opening day. I will be offering a piece of legislation, Give a Kid a Chance omnibus mental health legislation for our children of America.', u'It is time to get to work. It is time to pass good health care and good mental health care.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/06/07/H3745-5_report-on-conference-on-mental-health-issues/'}
