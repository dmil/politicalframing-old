There are ads currently running in my State claiming that I must not care about children having a mother and a father. How foolish. How sad. My wife Barbara, a social worker, and I will celebrate our 37th wedding anniversary tomorrow. We have three wonderful children and three beloved young grandchildren. Barbara and I are both former Sunday school teachers, and we have each in our own way devoted our careers to public service which advances the interests of families and particularly of children--and decent wages and farm incomes, affordable health care, affordable housing, high quality and affordable education, a truly profamily Tax Code, opposition to budget deficits which will have to be paid by our children and our grandchildren, advancing the cause of adoptions, advancing the programs which serve the needs of low-income expectant mothers and their early childhood needs. Ironically, these are all efforts which have largely been opposed by those who today tout the need for a marriage protection amendment.", "How cynical is that?", "I oppose gay marriage--and I voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act enacted years ago by this Congress. But marriage law in its details have been left to the respective States since the very beginning of our Nation, and there is no need today to speculate about what future courts may or may not do. There is no need today to strip these rights away from the States and to deny States the right even to interpret their own constitutions.", "My State of South Dakota has already enacted antigay marriage law and has taken up a possible State constitutional amendment to that effect. But that is where the debate ought to take place--in South Dakota and other States, not here in DC.", "I must add that this debate reminds me somewhat of an old children's fable where a child noted that the emperor has no clothes when all the adults around him were reluctant to similarly point out the obvious.", "Very frankly, the sanctity of my 37-year marriage is less at risk from gays than from ordinary heterosexuals who are behind high divorce rates, domestic abuse, and irresponsible refusal to provide for child support. Gay individuals seeking some legal structure in which to maintain a stable and loving relationship as opposed to promiscuity is less of a threat to my wife and I than public policy out of this Congress which works against the real needs of South Dakota families--involving decent wages, childcare, health insurance, and affordable housing.", "How wonderful would it be if we were here today talking about strategies that could strengthen our families and our communities, that would focus on the real needs of children rather than using them as a pawn in a cynical election-year charade.", "The American Constitution ought to be rarely amended--as all the generations of American leaders who served in this body understood. When it is amended, it ought to expand opportunity and freedom, and it ought to be consistent with being profamily in a real and serious way. There is a place for debate over gay marriage, but in South Dakota that debate ought to take place in Pierre and through public debate on the State constitution. All roads should not lead to Washington, DC.", "This Senate should once again resoundingly and in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner reject the pending amendment to our Nation's most sacred civil document, our United States Constitution.", "I yield the floor."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/05/S5401-10_unanimous-consent-request-hr-4437/"}
