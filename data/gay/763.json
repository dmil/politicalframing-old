Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. He has my strong support as well as the strong support of Senator Feinstein, who has made an eloquent statement on the Senate floor on his behalf.", "James Hormel is a successful businessman, a loving father, and a loving grandfather.", "On October 29, 1997 before the Foreign Relations Committee, I introduced James Hormel for the position of Ambassador to Luxembourg. At that hearing, I spoke of his sharp mind, distinguished career and extensive knowledge of diplomacy, international relations and the business world. Like many of my colleagues, I believe that James Hormel was, and still is, clearly qualified for this position.", "Almost five months later, this nomination still has not come to the Senate floor for a vote. The full Senate has not even had the opportunity to debate the merits of Mr. Hormel's nomination. This is because a hold has been placed on the nomination by certain Senators--apparently because of James Hormel's sexual orientation.", "I say, ``apparently'' because the arguments some have used to oppose Mr. Hormel do not ring true.", "The main argument is that Mr. Hormel, through his generous history of giving, has donated funds to certain projects--a library collection and an educational video--that contain controversial content. These are not valid arguments.", "First, it is my understanding that many of the books in question, which are found in the San Francisco Public Library, are also in the Library of Congress. Neither Congress nor James Hormel should be responsible for screening the subjects of books found in their libraries.", "And, second, James Hormel had absolutely no input into the content of the educational video. If the content of this video is a valid reason for the Senate to place a hold on this nominee, it sets a dangerous precedent.", "For instance, what if the next nominee that comes before the Senate has given money to his or her child's high school newspaper. And, what if that newspaper ran a controversial article about a particular Senator. Would the Senate then place a hold on that nomination? I don't think so. The holds are in place because James Hormel is gay.", "Mr. President, I believe that the Senate should consider nominees based on their qualifications. If the Senate agrees with me, there should be no controversy over James Hormel's nomination.", "James Hormel, of San Francisco, California, graduated from Swarthmore College and shortly thereafter earned his Juris Doctorate at the University of Chicago Law School. Mr. Hormel served for several years as the Dean of Students and Assistant Dean at the University of Chicago Law School. Since 1984, he has presided as Chairman of EQUIDEX, Inc., an investment firm based in San Francisco.", "For the past 30 years, Mr. Hormel has been a dedicated philanthropist, generously working to support a wide range of worthy causes. For his unselfish acts of giving, he has received several awards and honors. In 1996, he was named Philanthropist of the Year by the Golden Gate Chapter of the National Society of Fundraising Executives. Other honors include the Golden Gate Business Association's Outstanding Leadership Award, the Silver Spur Award from the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, the Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago Alumni Association, and many, many others.", "On the local level, Mr. Hormel is an active member of the San Francisco community working with several important civic organizations. His current projects include the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the San Francisco Symphony and the American Foundation for AIDS Research.", "Because of this impressive record, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of James Hormel by voice vote. And, as a matter of fact, just months before, the full Senate unanimously confirmed James Hormel to serve as a delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.", "Mr. President, James Hormel meets all requirements needed to be the ambassador to Luxembourg. If there is any doubt about Mr. Hormel's qualifications, we should have an open debate on the floor so these questions can be answered.", "In the end, I believe both this country and Luxembourg will benefit greatly from James Hormel as U.S. Ambassador.", "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield back the time to Senator Bennett.", "Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/03/13/S1913-4_nomination-of-james-c-hormel/"}
