The mayor of the District of Columbia said he is going to pocket veto this bill. We have to believe. I cannot believe any of us do not believe that he is going to do that. So if we believe he is going to do that, why are we doing this?", "He is going to insist that there be a religious exemption clause. People that have moral objections are going to be able to raise them. So why are we doing this, putting this offensive language in this bill? Just to show that we are more powerful than them, just to show them. She is right. This is wrong.", "Now, let me also say it is wrong for insurance companies to cover viagra for men and not cover contraception for women. Let us just tell it like it is. What could be more unfair? All this contraceptive equity provision says is that insurance companies ought to be fair and start respecting women, when contraception is the largest single expense, out-of-pocket expense, for women during most of their lives, and that is because of men's irresponsibility that, darn it, it ought to be covered.", "So it is the right legislation. They should have passed this legislation, and it is also true that most of these Catholic institutions are self-insured. It does not even apply to them. They are self-insured.", "Let me also say something, and I can only say this, I certainly would never say this if my own life were different, but having been educated in Catholic schools all my life, if I were a gay man, I would feel the same sense of frustration and disappointment that Councilman Jim Graham expressed on the D.C. council.", "That disappointment and the intolerance and, yes, the hypocrisy of the Catholic church as an institution towards homosexuality ought to be addressed. So I do not blame them for saying that. I know he wishes he had not said that, but these are debates that belonged in the D.C. council. These are debates and issues that should be settled, should be settled by the D.C. government.", "The Catholic institutions within the D.C. government have plenty of access. They are well respected, deservedly so. They contribute tremendous benefits to D.C. government and its society. They will be fully reflected in the legislation that becomes law, and that is the way it ought to be. We have no business getting involved in this issue, particularly when we have no legitimate role to play.", "The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) is absolutely right. The mayor is going to take care of that situation. Let him take care of the situation. He will be held accountable. He should be held accountable. He is elected. He understands it. He has a solution for it, and that is the way it should be, and what we are doing on this floor is not what should be done by this Congress. Madam Chairman, I gather we are going to continue this debate tomorrow."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/07/27/H7176-5_permission-to-insert-omitted-remarks-on-hr-4942-di/"}
