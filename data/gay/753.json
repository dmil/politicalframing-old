It is time to take action against crimes that are motivated by hate.", "I appreciate all of my colleagues that are coming here this evening that are going to take their time and to speak in support of H.R. 1343.", "In the past 3 months, crimes against Muslims, Arabs, Sikhs, Southeast Asians and anyone resembling these nationalities have increased significantly. The Council on Arab and Islamic Relations has compiled more than 1,400 reports of hate crimes since September 11. This represents a 51 percent increase in reported crimes against those of Middle Eastern descent since the attacks.", "Our children are watching in horror as they and their moms and their dads, their brothers, their sisters and close friends, are being harassed, spit on, beaten and, even worse, killed. These hate crimes are happening in their neighborhoods, at their schools, and their places of worship. This Congress does not want to stand by and let our children be subjected to this kind of hate. We cannot. We should not. The 107th Congress must recognize the problem at hand and must take effective measures to reverse this trend, and we can do that by bringing H.R. 1343 forward.", "The stories of these hate crime victims are disheartening. In Poughkeepsie, New York, a high school student was harassed and attacked while another student yelled ``I hate you, dirty Afghani,'' as he pelted him with rocks and plants.", "In Dumfries, Virginia, a mother and her son attacked two Afghani American brothers, age 16 and 17. During school the son and a group of his friends approached the two Afghani teenagers and began taunting and hitting them. The mother entered the fight and hit the 17-year-old youth in the head. Luckily, both boys escaped into a neighbor's home and luckily neither was seriously injured.", "In San Mateo, California, a gasoline bomb was thrown through the window of a Sikh family's home hitting a 3-year-old. Fortunately, the bomb failed to explode.", "These stories are both unbelievable and intolerable. But, sadly, these acts of hate are rampant, and people of Middle Eastern descent are not the only victims affected by ignorance and hate.", "Just a week ago, a hate crime occurred in my district. Three sophomores at a high school in my district assaulted a 17-year-old student because he was openly gay. The apparent leader of the assault paid two other boys $10 each to beat up the victim. Our children cannot be subjected to such violence and such hate.", "No one in America should live in fear because of his or her ethnic background, because of religious affiliation, because of gender, disability or sexual preference. This is especially true of our children.", "That is why it is important to pass meaningful hate crime legislation, and to pass it now. We need to strengthen our existing laws, and we must protect people against all hate crimes. We must send a message, especially to our children, that hateful behavior is wrong and it will not be tolerated.", "Our law enforcement officials need vigorous tools to fight and prosecute hate crimes. Yet existing Federal law is inadequate. That is why I am a strong supporter of the bill offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.", "For the first time under Federal law, this measure would add sexual orientation, gender and disability. In addition, it would expand Federal civil rights law to allow prosecution of hate crimes even if no federally protected activities were involved, such as voting or attending school. Also the bill would expand the circumstances under which the Federal Government could offer assistance to State and local governments to help prosecute these crimes.", "Even though the bill is cosponsored by over 200 bipartisan Members, it has been cast aside. We must bring it to the floor, and we must pass it now."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/12/05/H8884-2_the-local-law-enforcement-hate-crimes-prevention-a/"}
