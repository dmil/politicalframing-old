And then Mr. McCurry, after admitted pressure from the gay rights lobby, issued a clarification which changed the response or at least was intended to change the response. I quote from the Washington Post article which said:", "After protests from gay rights groups, McCurry yesterday said that contrary to an earlier statement, the Clinton administration does have concerns about how its [so-called] ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy [``so-called'' is my emphasis] on homosexuality is being enforced in the military.", "First of all, let me state that this, the current policy which is described by many as a ``don't-ask, don't-tell policy,'' is not descriptive of the particular policy. Therefore, I think it is important that we understand that what we are dealing with here is a law enacted by this Congress on a bipartisan basis, signed into law by the current President of the United States, and not subject to different interpretations but subject to exactly what is printed in the statute.", "Mr. McCurry needs to understand and the White House needs to understand that the prohibition against homosexuals serving in the military is a statutory requirement that was passed overwhelmingly by Congress and signed into law by the President, his President.", "The true test of whether the Department of Defense is faithfully executing the law is whether those who have engaged in or who have a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct are being separated from military service. That is the statute. That is the intent of the statute. That is the intent of the Congress, as enacted into statutory language and signed by the President.", "And that standard is that those who have engaged in or have a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct find themselves at a great inconsistency with longstanding military policy and are therefore eligible and should be separated from military service. That is the law of the land.", "Just a little bit of history.", "In January 1993, just days after his inauguration, President Clinton announced his intent to reverse the military's longstanding prohibition against homosexuals serving in the Armed Forces. That decision was uniformly opposed by our military commanders, and decisively overturned by the Congress after months of careful deliberation.", "Just to reiterate here, the President, very shortly after taking office, reversed longstanding military policy, and even though the President serves in his constitutional capacity as Commander in Chief, the leaders of our military unanimously opposed, publicly opposed the President's position saying that it would undermine morale, undermine the cohesiveness, undermine the very essence of what the military was designed to do.", "The Congress' consensus--after very considerable examination, hearings and debate--the Congress' consensus on the issue was clear, it was bipartisan, and it was broad. And the President ultimately signed a statutory prohibition against homosexuals serving in the military. He signed that into law.", "The law clearly sustained the Department of Defense longstanding policy and was based on several key findings of fact by the Congress. Those findings of fact are also law. And I would like to repeat those so that there is no confusion in this administration about either what the intent of Congress was or what the law was that passed the Congress and was signed by the President and now is operative.", "Let me just state some of these key findings.", "(1) Section 8, article I of the Constitution of the United States commits exclusively to the Congress the powers to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, and make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.", "As the committee report noted:", "The framers of the Constitution expressly vested the powers to raise and regulate military forces [they vested this power and authority] in the Congress.", "The statute goes on to say, with the findings:", "The President may supplement, but [he may] not supersede, the rules established by Congress for the Government and regulation of the Armed Forces. (2) There is no constitutional right to serve in the Armed Forces.", "The committee amplified:", "The primary mission of the Armed Forces is to defend our national interests by preparing for and, when necessary, waging war. . .. Responsibility for the awesome machinery of war requires a degree of training, discipline, and unit cohesion that has no parallel in civilian society. . . . The Armed Forces routinely restrict the opportunities for service on the basis of circumstances such as physical condition, age, sex, parental status, educational background, medical history, and mental attitude. . . . The fundamental precept [is] that the rights of the individual service member must be subordinated to the needs of national defense.", "And so in the instance, in the case where we formed our military, we do not follow the same rules, the same civil rights, the same rights that are available to Americans in other endeavors because of the unique function of the military, its unique calling and unique requirements for those individuals to serve in it. The many, many otherwise appropriate rights exercised by Americans are not rights granted to people who voluntarily agree to serve in the military or even if they are involuntarily called up, which we do not do anymore.", "(3) Pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, it lies within the discretion of the Congress to establish qualifications for and conditions of service in the Armed Forces. (4) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to prepare for and to prevail in combat should the need arise. (5) The conduct of military operations requires members of the Armed Forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including the ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common defense. (6) Success in combat requires military units that are characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.", "A critical element in this fact finding:", "(7) One of the most critical elements in combat capability is unit cohesion, that is the bonds of trust among individual service members that make the combat effectiveness of a military unit greater than the sum of the combat effectiveness of the individual unit members. (8) Military life is fundamentally different than civilian life in that the extraordinary responsibilities of the Armed Forces, the unique conditions of military service, and the critical role of unit cohesion, require that the military community, while subject to civilian control, exist as a special society; and the military society is characterized by its own laws, rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous restrictions on personal behavior, that would not be acceptable in civilian society. (9) The standards of conduct for members of the Armed Forces regulate a member's social life for 24 hours each day beginning at the moment the member enters military status and not ending until that person is discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces. (10) Those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, apply to a member of the Armed Forces at all times that the member has a military status, whether the member is on base or off base, and whether the member is on duty or off duty. (11) The pervasive application of the standards of conduct is necessary because members of the Armed Forces must be ready at all times for worldwide deployment to a combat environment. (12) The worldwide deployment of the United States military forces, the international responsibilities of the United States, and the potential for involvement of the armed forces in actual combat routinely make it necessary for members of the Armed Forces involuntarily to accept living conditions and working conditions that are often spartan, primitive, and characterized by forced intimacy with little or no privacy. (13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a longstanding element of military law that continues to be necessary in the unique circumstances of military service. (14) The Armed Forces must maintain personnel policies that exclude persons whose presence in the Armed Forces would create an unacceptable risk to the Armed Forces' high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability. (15) The presence in the Armed Forces of persons who demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.", "These are the facts as determined by the Senate Armed Forces Committee, by the Congress, both the House and the Senate, certified by us, written into law, signed into law by the President of the United States. These findings are as operative today as they were when they were passed. They are not subject to interpretation by the President. They are not subject to modification by the administration.", "The law of the land is clear: Homosexuals may not serve in the military. That is the law of the land. That is not the opinion of this Senator from Indiana. That is not subject to the opinion of the President's press secretary or people in the administration. It is the law of the land. The military has always defined, and continues to define, a homosexual as one who is engaged in or has a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct. Unfortunately, while the law speaks clearly, its popular title, ``don't ask, don't tell,'' is often confusing to the press and the public. It seems to imply that a homosexual may serve in the military as long as he or she is discrete. This is simply not the case and it misinterprets the law.", "The Senate Armed Services Committee report language is clear about the intent of the law, and again I quote:", "It would be irrational to develop military personnel policies on the basis that all gays and lesbians will remain celibate or that they will not be sexually attracted to others.", "Jamie Gorelick, then general counsel to the Department of Defense, testified:", "The military is not required to take the risk that you will not engage in the act.", "At a later hearing, she stated further:", "When someone makes a statement, it is reasonable to conclude that they will act, and the military is not required to take the risk that someone will not restrain a propensity.", "I want to remind the White House that its constitutional obligation is to enforce the law of the land. After a prolonged national debate on the question of homosexuals serving in the military, the President's position failed. Recognizing that defeat, he signed the National Defense Authorization Act of 1994 into law. In that act is the language now codified into law that clearly states the law of the land relative to homosexuals serving in the military. It is the obligation of the Department of Defense to separate those who engaged in, or have a propensity to engage in, homosexual conduct in the Armed Forces. Now, if the President wishes to reopen this debate, which I don't believe he does, he can look at modifying this law. But until that time, the administration has a constitutional duty to uphold that law, regardless of what pressure is politically applied upon the administration by any one group or number of groups or any one individual or group of individuals.", "So I wanted to put this in the Record so there was no misunderstanding about what the Congress had done, what the President had signed into law, and what the current law of the land is. This was the result of extensive--perhaps some of the most extensive--hearings the Senate Armed Services Committee has ever held. There were hundreds of witnesses, thousands of pages of testimony, site visits, testimony from people on all sides of the issue, representing every perspective. This was a carefully fashioned conclusion that was presented, approved by the committee, presented to the Congress and overwhelmingly approved by the Congress on a bipartisan basis, sent to the White House and signed into law by the President.", "I think it would behoove the President and the people speaking for him to understand clearly what this law is and to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities to uphold the law and not make vague clarifications of statements and policies simply because one or more particular group protested their particular position on the issue.", "I yield the floor."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/07/25/S8144_military-service-and-homosexuality/"}
