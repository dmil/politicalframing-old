They are a model for advocacy and an invaluable asset to our community.", "BCAP began in 1985 when two people volunteered two afternoons a week to answer a single borrowed telephone line. As the acronyms HIV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, became household terms, and as the stigma about what was termed a ``gay cancer'' relaxed, the name of the organization was formally changed to the Boulder County AIDS Project.", "BCAP has grown to include twelve staff members and over 300 volunteers. These volunteers work together with staff to serve those in the community who are infected with or affected by HIV and to educate the public about HIV and AIDS. In 2004, 368 HIV-infected individuals received services from the caseworkers and volunteers at BCAP; 17,000 youth and adults heard presentations by the BCAP Speakers Bureau, over 500 received HIV antibodies testing and counseling, and thousands of people attended BCAP's AIDS awareness events. The dedication demonstrated by BCAP staff and volunteers is a praiseworthy example of how to make a difference.", "As with all great causes and organizations in today's society, their merit stands before the blind eye of a restrictive budget. Despite the success of BCAP, many difficult obstacles affect the center. Changes in the federal response to HIV/AIDS impact their ability to provide evidence-based, scientifically-researched HIV prevention programming. Colorado state budget cuts affect BCAP's ability to meet the increased need for services in an economic climate of decreasing resources.", "In response to these challenges, BCAP recently adjusted their prevention programs to focus on access to HIV-antibody testing and early access to HIV care. BCAP and the Boulder County Public Health Department estimate that 30 percent of the population in BCAP's service area are HIV positive and are unaware of it. To address this issue, BCAP will purchase a van to be equipped as a mobile HIV testing facility. This will allow BCAP to meet one of its strategic goals of enhancing its HIV-antibody testing program while reducing a significant barrier to access and care--the access to easy testing.", "Even in the midst of struggle and looming challenges, the Boulder County AIDS Project goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide for those infected with HIV or affected by AIDS. Their dedication to this honorable cause has given dignity and comfort to individuals living with HIV and AIDS.", "Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in thanking the Boulder County AIDS Project for their efforts in this commendable cause."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/06/30/E1415_recognizing-boulder-county-aids-project-on-its-20t/"}
