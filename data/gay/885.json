Kennedy died, a tailor in New York put a sign on the door of his shop that read, ``Closed Due to a Death in the Family.''", "Well, that's how I felt when I heard that Park had passed away, like we had had a death in our family.", "Unfortunately, I was unable to attend Park's funeral. It was held during the week before election day, and I had committed to campaign for Al Gore and other Democratic candidates in Iowa.", "I felt awful that I would be missing the service, and I thought about taking the day off to attend it.", "But then it occurred to me--by hitting the road and working to get good Iowa Democrats elected, I was paying my respects just the way Park would have wanted.", "Park Rinard was a legend in Iowa Democratic politics. He began his political career back in 1957 as an aide to Governor Herschel Loveless.", "He then befriended a rough-hewn, young, Iowa truck driver who had a beef with the state's trucking policies. Park persuaded this disgruntled fellow--a man by the name of Harold Hughes--to join the Democratic party and run for office. The rest, as they say, is history, and Hughes later referred to Park as his tutor in government.", "Park went on to advise Senator John Culver, Congressman Neal Smith, and many others who have made their mark on our Nation.", "Mr. President, when I think back on Park's career, I'm reminded of something that Adlai Stevenson once said: ``Every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of things that are to be.'' That's a perfect description of Park Rinard.", "Like my hero, Hubert Humphrey, Park believed that ``. . . the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy . . .'' And Park had a vision of government big enough and bold enough to encompass all of them.", "He envisioned a government that trusted citizens--that believed in their strength and capacity to learn, work and serve a government that would invest in people and leave the potential of no citizen untapped. Through his work with Governor Hughes, Park transformed that vision into the wave of progressive legislation that characterized the ``Golden Age'' of Iowa politics.", "During these years, Park helped establish Iowa's community college system, create the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, and appoint the first black state judge in Iowa. He worked to grant home rule for cities, increase spending for schools, and abolish the death penalty. And he successfully convinced Governor Hughes to oppose the Vietnam war. These achievements were Park's proudest legacies, and some of his most enduring.", "But Park also had a vision for America--a vision which he spent the remainder of his career fighting for in Congress. He believed deeply in expanding women's rights, and he was a strong supporter of the equal rights amendment long before it penetrated the popular consciousness. He also spoke passionately about ending discrimination against gay Americans, long before many others.", "But make no mistake about it, Park wasn't a knee-jerk liberal, not by a long shot. He just believed in a fundamental, basic, golden rule kind of fairness. That was his moral compass, and he steadfastly followed where it led. It is therefore unsurprising that Park had such disdain for polls and focus groups. For Park, politics wasn't about pandering and spin, it was about leadership and telling the truth.", "And tell the truth he did. No matter whom he was speaking with, Park Rinard did not mince words. He was once asked by a hostile audience how his boss could even consider supporting food stamps for union strikers. Park simply replied, ``hungry people are hungry people.''", "A gifted speechwriter, Park wielded the written word as forcefully as the spoken. He spent hours pecking away at his old manual typewriter, massaging policy into poetry often finishing a speech at the last possible moment, sometimes just minutes before his boss was scheduled to deliver it.", "Park never hesitated to use his gift for strong language to stand up to his bosses--some of whom were nearly twice his size--when he thought they were wrong.", "Park once told a fellow staffer, ``Remember, you might work for one particular Senator, but your paycheck is from the Senate of the United States, and every employee of the Senate works for the people of America.'' That was Park's ultimate loyalty--to the people his bosses served. When Park stood up to his bosses, he was standing up for the American people.", "And perhaps most extraordinary in this city that's seen its share of egos and ambition is that Park worked his magic entirely behind the scenes, happy to slip through back doors and pound out details in back rooms. Park felt that, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once noted, ``There is no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the credit.'' He never cared who got the applause and the pat on the back for his own hard work. He just cared about doing right.", "Park was fundamentally humble. He spent a lot of time among giants--Governors, Presidential candidates, great political leaders--but his ego never swelled to match. Park believed, as the saying goes, that ``you don't have to be who's who to know what's what.''", "He was as comfortable lending a hand to a lost tourist, saying a kind word to a new intern, or shooting the breeze with a cafeteria employee as he was chewing out a Senator whom he felt had gone awry. There were no small people with Park Rinard.", "All people mattered to Park--and his family mattered most of all. He was a devoted husband to his wife Phyllis, a proud father to his children Judy, David and Grant, and a doting grandfather to his grandson David Bayard. Their generosity in sharing him is appreciated by all of us enriched by his life.", "The poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once wrote that ``Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time.'' Park was a great man. And he left lasting footprints on the political landscape of Iowa and America.", "Today, in part because of the foundation he laid, Iowa leads the nation in education and literacy, and it's ranked as one of the top ten states to raise a child. And today, because of the dialogues he helped begin, the idea of banning discrimination against women and minorities or passing hate crimes laws no longer seems novel, but natural.", "These are Park Rinard's footprints--echoes from a golden time in our history when this slight, softspoken man made it his mission to create a more humane world for the most vulnerable among us.", "With his words and ideas, both written and spoken, Park Rinard appealed to the best in those he worked for and stood for nothing less.", "We are lucky that so many great men and women heeded his call and made good on his dreams.", "I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the eulogy read by Senator John Culver at Park Rinard's funeral."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/12/05/S11555_park-rinard-memorial/"}
