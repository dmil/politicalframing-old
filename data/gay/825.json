Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis once wrote that ``the best disinfectant is sunshine,'' and it is in that spirit that I submit ``The Guilt-Free Record of George Soros'' to be printed in the Congressional Record.", u'``I am basically there to--to make money. I cannot and do not look at the social consequences of--of what I do.\'\' George Soros, commenting on being blamed for the financial collapse of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and Russia. ``He can move world financial markets simply by voicing an opinion or destabilize a government by buying and selling its currency . . . [W]hen he saw cracks in the Asia boom, he began selling the currency in Thailand. Traders in Hong Kong followed suit, triggering a financial crisis that plunged much of Asia into a depression. (``George Soros,\'\' 60 Minutes interview transcript, December 20, 1998) ``I don\'t feel guilty. Because I\'m engaged in an amoral activity which is not meant to have anything to do with guilt.\'\' George Soros, commenting on his actions in the currency markets. (``George Soros,\'\' 60 Minutes interview transcript, December 20, 1998) Soros Convicted of Insider-Trading, Ordered to Pay $2.8 million. ``George Soros\'s bid to overturn an insider-trading conviction has been rejected by France\'s highest appeals court, ending the billionaire\'s fight to erase a legal stain on his 40-year investing career. The Court of Cassation, the tribunal of last resort in France, ended its review of a March 2005 judgment that Soros broke insider-trading laws when he bought Societe Generale SA shares in 1988 with the knowledge that the bank might be a takeover target. Soros had been ordered to pay back 2.2 million euros ($2.8 million) in gains.\'\' (Gabriele Parussini, ``Soros Insider-Trading Conviction Upheld by Paris Appeals Court,\'\' Bloomberg, June 14, 2006) Soros: ``No Sense of Guilt\'\' for Confiscating Property from Jews in Nazi-occupied Budapest. ``But there was no sense that I shouldn\'t be there, because that was--well, actually, in a funny way, it\'s just like in markets--that if I weren\'t there--of course, I wasn\'t doing it, but somebody else would . . . be taking it away anyhow . . . whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the--I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\'\' (``George Soros,\'\' 60 Minutes interview transcript, December 20, 1998) Extended quotation from the 60 Minutes transcript follows: ``When the Nazis occupied Budapest in 1944, George Soros\' father was a successful lawyer. He lived on an island in the Danube and liked to commute to work in a rowboat. But knowing there were problems ahead for the Jews, he decided to split his family up. He bought them forged papers and he bribed a government official to take 14-year-old George Soros in and swear that he was his Christian godson. But survival carried a heavy price tag. While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews.

(Vintage footage of women and men with bags over their shoulders walking; crowd by a train) KROFT: (Voiceover) You\'re a Hungarian Jew . . . Mr. SOROS: (Voiceover) Mm-hmm. KROFT: (Voiceover) . . . who escaped the Holocaust . . . (Vintage footage of women walking by train) Mr. SOROS: (Voiceover) Mm-hmm. (Vintage footage of people getting on train) KROFT: (Voiceover) . . . by--by posing as a Christian. Mr. SOROS: (Voiceover) Right. (Vintage footage of women helping each other get on train; train door closing with people in boxcar) KROFT: (Voiceover) And you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps. Mr. SOROS: Right. I was 14 years old. And I would say that that\'s when my character was made. KROFT: In what way? Mr. SOROS: That one should think ahead. One should understand and--and anticipate events and when--when one is threatened. It was a tremendous threat of evil. I mean, it was a--a very personal experience of evil. KROFT: My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted godson. Mr. SOROS: Yes. Yes. KROFT: Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews. Mr. SOROS: Yes. That\'s right. Yes. KROFT: I mean, that\'s--that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult? Mr. SOROS: Not--not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don\'t--you don\'t see the connection. But it was--it created no--no problem at all. KROFT: No feeling of guilt? Mr. SOROS: No. KROFT: For example that, ``I\'m Jewish and here I am, watching these people go. I could just as easily be there. I should be there.\'\' None of that? Mr. SOROS: Well, of course I c--I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn\'t be there, because that was--well, actually, in a funny way, it\'s just like in markets--that if I weren\'t there--of course, I wasn\'t doing it, but somebody else would--would--would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the--whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the--I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\'\' (``George Soros,\'\' 60 Minutes interview transcript, December 20, 1998). Soros Said That President Bush\'s Statements Remind Him of Nazi Slogans. `` `When I hear Bush say, `You\'re either with us or against us,\' it reminds me of the Germans.\' It conjures up memories, he said, of Nazi slogans on the walls, Der Feind Hort mit (`The enemy is listening\'). `My experiences under Nazi and Soviet rule have sensitized me,\' he said in a soft Hungarian accent.\' \'\' (Laura Blumenfeld, ``Soros\'s Deep Pockets vs. Bush,\'\' The Washington Post, November 11, 2003). Soros Is the Primary Financier of Left-Wing Causes. Tax records of Soros\' Open Society Institute show contributions of: $4.41 million to the American Civil Liberties Union and its state affiliates; $500,000 to the Pro-Choice Education Project to launch a (pro-abortion rights) ``public education and media strategy;\'\' $100,000 to Catholics for a Free Choice, an allegedly Catholic group that advocates for abortion rights; $100,000 to the Death Penalty Information Center, an organization that works against capital punishment; $100,000 to the Pennsylvania Coalition to Save Lives Now ``to support needle exchange programs,\'\' $80,000 over three years to the Gay Straight Alliance Network, to promote ``a traveling photo documentary exhibit by lesbian, gay, transgender, queer and questioning youth;\'\' $35,000 to the Abortion Access Project. (Jeff Johnson, ``George Soros\'\' $30M Welfare Check,\'\' CNSNews.com, April 26, 2005). The Soros Prostitution Agenda. Open Society Institute (OSI), a foundation funded and controlled by George Soros, sued the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ``over requirement that recipients of federal AIDS grants pledge to oppose prostitution. The group would be the second charity to challenge the policy, which AIDS activists say stigmatizes prostitutes and makes it harder to fight the disease.\'\' In June 2006, Open Society Institute published a study entitled ``Sex Workers Health and Rights: Where is the Funding?\'\' The report highlighted the role of OSI and various Soros foundations, in financing ``a large number of sex workers organizations\'\' and attacked the Bush Administration policy for refusing to fund such groups. OSI received at least $30 million between 1998 and 2003 from the federal government, mostly from the State Department.

The billionaire financier, who calls the drug war `a fantasy\' and says it does more harm to America than drugs themselves, has spent big money pushing his position that we should treat drug abuse as a medical problem, not a criminal one.\'\' (Bill Steigerwald, ``Newsweek Wants A Drug Debate,\'\' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 30, 1997). Soros is Major Financier Behind Drug Legalization Groups. In 1994, Soros pledged $4 million over five years to the Lindesmith Center, a pro-marijuana legalization think-tank that merged with the Drug Policy Foundation to form the Drug Policy Alliance, which supports legalization of marijuana for ``medical\'\' purposes, repealing mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, ending imprisonment for drug possession. (Neil Hrab, ``George Soros\' Social Agenda for America,\'\' Capital Research Center\'s Foundation Watch, &lt;a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/x3770435801.pdf"&gt;http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/x3770435801.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) Soros Heavily Financed Drug Legalization Efforts For Marijuana. ``And the award for best supporting role goes to billionaire George Soros, the Daddy Warbucks of drug legalization. He doesn\'t reside in either state [Arizona or California], but he bankrolled both efforts. . . . Most money used to buy misleading TV ads for both referenda came from out of state. In Arizona, as of the most recent reporting date (May 31), of $300,490 contributed to support Prop. 200, only $490 came from in state. The remaining $300,000 came from out of state, $200,000 of it from the Drug Policy Foundation--a pet charity of George Soros\'--and the other $100,000 came directly from Soros himself.\'\' (Joseph A. Califano Jr., ``Pro-Drug Campaigns\' Hidden Agenda,\'\' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 22, 1996) Soros Helped Finance a Pro-Marijuana Children\'s Book. ``Dr. Robert Newman, served on the Board of Directors for the Drug Policy Foundation as early as 1997, and presently serves on the board of directors with another minority witness, Rev. Edwin Sanders, of the Drug Policy Alliance (the new name of the Drug Policy Foundation since its merger with the aforementioned Lindesmith Center). The Drug Policy Alliance describes itself as ``the nation\'s leading organization working to end the war on drugs.\'\' Along with its major donor George Soros, it helped produce It\'s Just a Plant, a promarijuana children\'s book. I will be very interested in learning from the witnesses today what they believe U.S. Government policy should be with respect to financing heroin distribution, safe-injection facilities, and how-to manuals like H Is For Heroin, published by the Harm Reduction Coalition, and children\'s books on smoking marijuana, produced with the help of the organization run by two of the minority\'s witnesses today.\'\' (Mark Souder, opening statement, ``Harm Reduction or Harm Maintenance: Is There Such a Thing as Safe Drug Abuse?\'\', hearing before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, February 16, 2005, &lt;a href="http://www.dpna.org/resources/current/02-16-5c.htm"&gt;http://www.dpna.org/resources/current/02-16-5c.htm&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.justaplant.com"&gt;http://www.justaplant.com&lt;/a&gt;) Soros and Two Friends give $450,000 to ``take apart [California\'s] criminal justice system one step at a time.\'\' ``International financier George Soros and two other wealthy donors have contributed a total of $450,000 for a November ballot measure that would alter California\'s tough three strikes sentencing law . . . The donation marks the third time that this trio has backed criminal justice measures in California. In 1996, the three gave money to pass Proposition 215, which sought to legalize marijuana for medical uses. In 2000, they supported the successful Proposition 36, which diverts drug offenders from prison to treatment.\'\' (Bill Ainsworth, ``$450,000 to help try to weaken law,\'\' San Diego Union-Tribune, September 14, 2004.) Soros Effort To Infiltrate the U.S. Conservative Movement. ``The scheduled Friday CPAC event on ``A Conservative Drug Policy\'\' was to feature a mini-debate between Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) and Calvina Fay. The ``moderator,\'\' hardly unbiased, was scheduled to be Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). The Soros Open Society Institute has given the DPA millions of dollars, including $2.5 million in 2004 alone. MPP has been funded by Soros as well as Peter Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Corporation, who was arrested in New Zealand several years ago after customs officers found marijuana in his luggage. Lewis, who gave $340,000 to MPP in 2004, is also a major funder of the ACLU.\'\' (Mark Souder, Congressional Record, insertion in the record of article by Cliff Kincaid, February 8, 2006, &lt;a href="http://reform.house.gov/CJDPHR/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=39349)"&gt;http://reform.house.gov/CJDPHR/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=39349)&lt;/a&gt; Soros Support of Lynne Stewart, Lawyer to Terrorists. ``George Soros funds many controversial projects, some extreme projects. One quick example is the $20,000 that went from his Open Society Institute to the Lynne Stewart Legal Committee. Lynne Stewart was the attorney who represented the blind sheik who was involved in the first bombing of the World Trade Centers and was later convicted for aiding and abetting his activities while in prison.\'\' (Peter Flaherty of the National Legal and Policy Center, O\'Reilly Factor, May 20, 2005, relying on Open Society Institute IRS Form 990 filings. Byron York, ``Soros Funded Stewart Defense,\'\' National Review, February 17, 2005.) Soros Attacks ``War on Terror,\'\' Compares Bush Administration to Nazis. Soros told an audience at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, ``We are working with a very false frame when we talk about a `war on terror,\' and yet it is universally accepted.\'\' He added, ``President Bush is exploiting it even further ahead of these elections . . . I would voice my concerns about the similarities between this administration and the Nazis and communist regimes.\'\' (Monisha Bansal, ``Soros Slams Terror \'War,\' Compares White House to Nazis,\'\' CNSNews.com, September 15, 2006.) Soros To Encourage a U.S./Europe Split. ``Soros, the Hungarian-American financier who has historically invested his billions in encouraging democracy in eastern block countries, is turning his attention to Western Europe because he thinks the EU is failing. Soros is to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in foundations, the first of which will be either in London or Paris.\'\' Soros: ``The practical message for Europeans is that the world really needs a strong European Union with a mission which is different to America\'s priorities.\'\' (Rupert Stein, ``Soros lays foundations to restore EU purpose,\'\' The Scotsman, July 15, 2006.)'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/09/29/E1917_the-guilt-free-record-of-george-soros/'}
