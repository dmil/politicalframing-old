Res. 948, recognizing the dedication of the employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Stennis Space Center.", "I cannot honor and commend these employees enough for their heroism during and after Hurricane Katrina's assault on Mississippi. The Stennis Space Center employees provided shelter and medical care to storm evacuees and logistical support for storm recovery efforts, while effectively maintaining critical facilities at the center.", "During Hurricane Katrina, some 3,700 persons, including employees, their immediate and extended families, and members of the general public, sought shelter at the Stennis Space Center.", "The Stennis cafeteria, which normally serves about 175 breakfasts and 600 lunches each day, served 3,000 meals 3 times a day to evacuees, for a period of a week following the storm.", "Before, during, and in the immediate aftermath of the storm, the small staff of the Stennis Medical Clinic provided medical care to all who needed it among the evacuees onsite. This included some 20 special needs patients, and soon after the storm, the Stennis clinic staff was complemented by medical personnel airlifted from other National Aeronautics and Space Administration Centers.", "Although commercial electrical power was not available to Stennis for 10 days following the storm, electrical power was maintained to all essential buildings through the extensive use of diesel-powered generators and the around the clock efforts of a team of individuals who mechanically maintained those generators and kept them fueled. This also enabled the pumps on Stennis's deep-water wells to provide a continuous supply of potable water for drinking, cooking, and sanitation to support the 3,700 people onsite.", "These brave individuals include: Cheryl Bennett, James Bevis, Terry Bordelon, Steve Brettel, Vicki Brown, Bill Brumfield, Kirt Bush, Paul Byrd, Ethan Calder, Marla Carpenter, David Carstens, Jonathan Clemens, Eric Crawford, Cheri Cuevas, John Davenport, David Del Santo, Isaac DeLancey, Jim Freeman, Greg Garrett, Dave Geiger, Stan Gill, Don Griffith, Haynes Haselmaier, Coby Holloway, Gay Irby, Manning ``JJ'' Jones, Catriona Ladner, David Ladner, Richard Ladner, Stanley Lee, Michelle Logan, Ron Magee, Sharlene Majors, Steve McCord, Pat McCullough, Michael McDaniel, Mike McKinion, Kirk Miller, John Mitchell, Ron Moore, David R. Oakes, Kevin A. Oliver, Alan Phillips, John Nick Pitalo, Allen Price, Porter Pryor, Margaret Roberts, Miguel Rodriguez, Jason Saucier, Dale Sewell, Donald Seymore, Kathy Slade, Sue Smith, David Throckmorton, Karen Vander, John Waquespack, Rodney Wilkinson, Robert Williams, and Michael J. Witt.", "Thank you, to all of these employees, for their selfless and honorable actions. I urge my colleagues to support this measure."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/09/26/H7486_recognizing-the-dedication-of-the-employees-at-the/"}
