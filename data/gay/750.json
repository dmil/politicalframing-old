Certainly the people of Indiana are proud to see him in the chair, and we are delighted to be reconvening this Monday morning.", "Let me just thank, as chairman of the Travel and Tourism Caucus, my colleagues for working quickly on Friday to bring about some financial stability to the airline industry. And of course today, as I speak, the market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up some 350 points, and so we hope we have turned the corner on pessimism; and I know there is still opportunity to review and reflect on what the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) just spoke of.", "We can certainly be Monday-morning quarterbacks and look back and see what we could have done differently. I hope prospectively we now start reviewing all the safety measures affecting our traveling public. We have to ensure stability in the marketplace. We have to make certain that airlines, of course, work on safety precautions, but the Government has to be a partner.", "On Friday, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle objected to any bailout, suggesting somehow that that was unfair to the industry. I can assure you today we would be seeing a lot more massive economic downturn and a lot more jobs lost had we not acted.", "Today, I wanted to spend a moment on two things: one, a constituent of mine, Dino Laudati, wrote this the morning of the tragedy, and he calls it ``Eternal Flame of America.''", "``As I watched in horror and grief as the towers of the World Trade Center burned, I cried in pain and disbelief. As I wiped the tears from my eyes and removed my hands from my face, I had a vision.", "``In front of me the burning towers turned into burning torches, torches of hope, torches of courage and strength, torches of unity and love, torches that will guide us into the darkness to seek and defeat our enemy. The same enemy that ignited that fire, believing he could bring us to our knees.", "``Torches that will engulf our hearts with love and tenacity, torches that will always burn, for the freedom that America stands for and that every American will fight for and would rather die than succumb to defeat or submission.", "``Torches that will always remind us that we are all equal no matter what religion, race or background and we stand together in peace, brotherhood and love. We believe that God is the only one who is above us. He enables us to carry within us the fire of the burning towers as torches of eternal light.", "``To remind us that America is freedom and freedom is America. Our forefathers established it, our fathers believed in it, we will fight for it and our children will keep it forever.", "``Dino Laudati, September 11, 2001.''", "Dianne Robbins from my district office sent this along. Her daughter sent it to her, Beth Horner.", "``On Monday we e-mailed jokes.", "On Tuesday we did not.", "On Monday we thought that we were secure.", "On Tuesday we learned better.", "On Monday we were talking about heroes as being athletes.", "On Tuesday we relearned who our heroes are.", "On Monday we were irritated that our rebate checks had not arrived.", "On Tuesday we gave money away to people we had never met.", "On Monday there were people fighting against praying in schools.", "On Tuesday you would have been hard pressed to find a school where someone was not praying.", "On Monday people argued with their kids about picking up their room.", "On Tuesday the same people could not get home fast enough to hug their kids.", "On Monday people were upset that they had to wait 6 minutes in a fast food drive-through line.", "On Tuesday people didn't care about waiting up to 6 hours to give blood for the dying.", "On Monday we waved our flags signifying our cultural diversity.", "On Tuesday we waved only the American flag.", "On Monday there were people trying to separate each other by race, sex, color and creed.", "On Tuesday they were all holding hands.", "On Monday we were men or women, black or white, old or young, rich or poor, gay or straight, Christian or non-Christian.", "On Tuesday we were all Americans.", "On Monday politicians argued about budget surpluses.", "On Tuesday, grief stricken, they sang `God Bless America.'", "On Monday the President was going to Florida to read to children.", "On Tuesday he returned to Washington to protect our children.", "On Monday we had families.", "On Tuesday we had orphans.", "On Monday people went to work as usual.", "On Tuesday they died.", "On Monday people were fighting the 10 Commandments on government property.", "On Tuesday the same people all said `God help us all' while thinking `Thou shall not kill.' ''", "It is sadly ironic how it takes horrific events to place things into perspective, but it has. The lessons learned this week, the things we have taken for granted, the things that have been forgotten or overlooked, hopefully will never be forgotten again.", "These are messages from our community and our constituents. I am certain every Member in Congress probably has similar that they have received. The outpouring of support for our Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, has been wonderful.", "In Palm Beach County, a county I come from, a typical blood bank volume is 500 pints a week. Last week when I visited Palm Beach County that same blood bank, and I will use the phrase used then by George Bush, the President, the President's father, a thousand points of light. Well, last week in Palm Beach County there were 7,000 pints of life supporting New York and Washington.", "I commend my community. I commend this Congress. I am proud to be an American. I thank all who have witnessed and watched us work together on behalf of the American people."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/09/24/H5932_commenting-on-letters-from-constituents-after-the-/"}
