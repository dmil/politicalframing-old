And also I believe it is enormously important to emphasize the collaborative work between the Asian Pacific Caucus, of which I am a member, the Hispanic Caucus, of which I am an adopted daughter, and the Congressional Black Caucus.", "I am also very pleased to be on the floor with our chair of the Congressional Black Caucus health brain trust, which I have been a Member on, I believe, for as long as I can remember, to join us for what is really an indictment of American society. It is an indictment of this government, frankly, and the correction that is due is long overdue. That is the whole question of health disparities.", "We have heard an eloquent presentation by Hilda Solis on the question of diabetes. We heard from the distinguished gentlewoman from Guam who spoke about the Pacific illnesses that impact the Asian Pacific community, and I rise to speak holistically about the health crisis in America that does not address the longstanding question of disparities in health care.", "I am reminded of an African American gentleman in a Florida hospital just a few years ago who was to go into surgery and hopefully had all the T's crossed and I's dotted. Lo and behold, the wrong leg was amputated. He obviously suffered from, as we call in our community, sugar diabetes, and rather than be cured, unfortunately, his situation was made worse by amputating the wrong leg.", "There is extensive documentation that indicates that the question of health access or access to health care falls heavily on minorities, and particularly African Americans. In fact, there is data to suggest that African Americans, when given access to the Nation's hospitals and other health facilities, that the care is less than it is for other populations. That, in itself, does not speak to the greatness of this Nation and the fact that this Nation is considered a world power.", "If you want to speak to inequities of language, you will find in Hispanic communities, in particular, that before we started moving on community health clinics and really making a push to have culturally sensitive treatment, you will find in many instances that there was a lack of ability to communicate with Hispanic populations because of the language barrier. These, my friends, were citizens, people who were permanent legal residents, who could not get the proper health care.", "Today, I rise to acknowledge the importance of National Minority Health Month, but really to give us a challenge that we maybe have come this far by faith, as many of us have been known to say, but we have a mighty long way.", "Let me just share some of the indictments of poor health care in America. African American adolescents accounted for 65 percent of new AIDS cases reported among teens in 2002, although they only account for 15 percent of American teenagers.", "We also recognize that the leading cause of death of young African American males between the ages of 15 and 24, that cause is not disease or accidental death, but homicide.", "We recognize, as has been already noted, that obesity is an increasing dilemma for America. It certainly is a dilemma for minority populations and African Americans.", "Let me express appreciation for joining Congressman Donald Payne a few weeks ago for a very exciting conference on obesity, so much so that it was contagious. Those of us, as Members of Congress who were able to attend, with the University of New Jersey medical and dental school, are going to repeat that conference around the country. I know that we in Houston look forward to hosting a conference on obesity.", "A few weeks ago, the Congressional Children's Caucus hosted, with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a briefing on obesity, where we focused on what happens to obese children and obese infants as well.", "Just a couple of days ago, I believe Friday, I was very gratified to participate with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and the CBC Health Brain Trust on the status of African American men, questions of mental health, the question of homicide, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, abuse, and the preservation of the good health of African American men.", "Every time I rise to speak about this question, I pay tribute to my father, my late father, a man who worked hard for his family, who believed that no job was beneath him to support his family, a man who was a brilliant artist. But because of segregation, the work that he had, he was, if you will, replaced when men came back who happened to be white, from World War II.", "But even with all of those trials and tribulations, he kept his hand involved in art, and in the later part of his life, he got another chance to work 10 years for one of the comic book companies in New York. Who would have thought that he would have been a victim of prostate cancer. When I say a victim, not diagnosed, so much so that ultimately it metastasized to his lung and his brain. My most visual memory of him was him laying in a fetal position in a hospital bed, way before the time, and he died of that dastardly disease.", "But I think one of the challenges was that in the male line of our family, that cancer is prevalent, but not being diagnosed, or having access to health care that would inform us, we saw uncles pass without really knowing what they were dying of.", "So today, now, 2007, a tribute to my father, Ezra Jackson, and relatives across America who have died undiagnosed, whose families were not aware of, maybe, the DNA or their characteristics for these diseases, because of the poor access to health care. We stand today, one, wanting a universal access to health care system; two, passing the Congressional Black Caucus and the bill that went to the Senate, dealing with disparities in health care, that, as I understand, Dr. Christensen, we never got passed. We need to get it passed in this Congress.", "Then I would just simply say that each of us must hold forums in our districts on the question of disparities in health care. As I do the obesity one, we look forward to putting together an advisory committee on black males that talks about health care as well.", "Let me close by simply saying that I could recount for you any number of statistics on health care. I think my colleagues have accurately pronounced these challenges. But let me give a roll call to show you where we have these devastating, if you will, disparities, so that you won't think that we are limited, hypertension, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gall bladder disease, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea and other respiratory problems, cancer, which is breast, colon and endometrial.", "We expect that we will do a better job of trying, if you will, of trying to improve the health conditions in America. We must do so. It is a civil rights issue. I want to thank you so much for highlighting and provoking us to be part of the change of creating opportunities for better health for all Americans, and particularly those experiencing these health disparities.", "Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize the importance of National Minority Health Month. National Minority Health Month is a very important time to bring awareness to the many health concerns facing minority communities. My colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus and I understand the very difficult challenges facing us in the form of huge health disparities among our community and other minority communities. We will continue to seek solutions to those challenges. It is imperative for us to improve the prospects for living long and healthy lives and fostering an ethic of wellness in African-American and other minority communities. I wish to pay special tribute to my colleague, Congresswoman Donna Christensen, the Chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, for organizing an important conference last week on the health and wellness of African-American males. I thank all of my CBC colleagues who been toiling in the vineyards for years developing effective public policies and securing the resources needed to eradicate racial and gender disparities in health and wellness.", "Let me focus these brief remarks on what I believe are three of the greatest impediments to the health and wellness of the African-American community and other minority communities. The first challenge is combating the scourge of HIV/AIDS. Second, we must reverse the dangerous trend of increasing obesity in juveniles and young adults. Finally, we must confront the leading cause of death of young African-American males between the ages of 15-24; that cause is not disease or accidental death, but homicide.", "In 1981, HIV/AIDS was thought by most Americans to be a new, exotic, and mysterious disease which seemed to inflict primarily gay white males in New York City and San Francisco. But since then we have learned that in the America of 2006, AIDS is overwhelmingly a black and brown disease. And that means that we have to assume the major responsibility for finding the solutions to rid our communities of this scourge. Consider the magnitude of the challenge confronting us:", "HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of death among African-Americans ages 25 to 44--ahead of heart disease, accidents, cancer, and homicide.", "The rate of AIDS diagnoses for African-Americans in 2003 was almost 10 times the rate for whites.", "Between 2000 and 2003, the rate of HIV/AIDS among African-American males was seven times the rate for white males and three times the rate for Hispanic males.", "African-American adolescents accounted for 65 percent of new AIDS cases reported among teens in 2002, although they only account for 15 percent of American teenagers.", "Billions and billions of private and federal dollars have been poured into drug research and development to treat and ``manage'' infections, but the complex life cycle and high mutation rates of HIV strains have only marginally reduced the threat of HIV/AIDS to global public health.", "Although the drugs we currently have are effective in managing infections and reducing mortality by slowing the progression to AIDS in an individual, they do little to reduce disease prevalence and prevent new infections. It simply will not suffice to rely upon drugs to manage infection. We can make and market drugs until we have 42 million individually tailored treatments, but so long as a quarter of those infected remain detached from the importance of testing, we have no chance of ending or even ``managing'' the pandemic.", "Currently, the only cure we have for HIV/AIDS is prevention. While we must continue efforts to develop advanced treatment options, it is crucial that those efforts are accompanied by dramatic increases in public health education and prevention measures.", "Learning whether one is infected with HIV before the virus has already damaged the immune system represents perhaps the greatest opportunity for preventing and treating HIV infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), between 2000 and 2003, 56 percent of late testers--defined as those who were diagnosed with full-blown AIDS within one year after learning they were HIV-positive--were African-Americans, primarily African-American males.", "African-Americans males with HIV have tended to delay being tested because of psychological or social reasons, which means they frequently are diagnosed with full-blown AIDS soon after learning they are infected with HIV. This is the main reason African American males with AIDS do not live as long as persons with HIV/AIDS from other racial/ethnic groups.", "Researchers have identified two unequal tracks of HIV treatment and care in the United States. In the first, or ``ideal track,'' a person discovers she or he is HIV-infected, seeks medical care, has regular follow-ups, and follows a regimen without complications. Persons in this track can now in most cases lead a normal life.", "But some individuals follow a second, more-dangerous track. These individuals come to the hospital with full-blown AIDS as their initial diagnosis. They may have limited access to care because of finances or because other social or medical problems interfere. The vast majority of deaths from HIV/AIDS are among this second group. And the persons making up this group are disproportionately African-American males.", "I have strongly supported legislation sponsored by CBC members and others to give increased attention and resources to combating HIV/AIDS, including the Ryan White CARE Act. I support legislation to reauthorize funding for community health centers (H.R. 5573, Health Centers Renewal Act of 2006), including the Montrose and Fourth Ward clinics in my home city of Houston, and to provide more nurses for the poor urban communities in which many of these centers are located (H.R. 1285, Nursing Relief Act for Disadvantaged Areas). I have also authored legislation aimed to better educate our children (H.R. 2553, Responsible Education About Life Act in 2006) and eliminate health disparities (H.R. 3561, Healthcare Equality and Accountability Act and the Good Medicine Cultural Competency Act in 2003, H.R. 90).", "Twenty-five years from now, I hope that we will not be discussing data on prevalence and mortality of HIV/AIDS among African-American males, but rather how our sustained efforts at elimination have come into fruition. But for us to have that discussion, we must take a number of actions now. We must continue research on treatments and antiretroviral therapies, as well as pursue a cure. We absolutely have to ensure that everyone who needs treatment receives it. And we simply must increase awareness of testing, access to testing, and the accuracy of testing. Because we will never be able to stop this pandemic if we lack the ability to track it.", "African-Americans males are eleven times as likely to be infected with HIV/AIDS, so we must make eleven times the effort to educate them until HIV/AIDS becomes a memory. If we do not, then the African-American male will indeed become an endangered species.", "When it comes to the scourge of HIV/AIDS, the African-American community is at war. It is a war we absolutely have to win because at stake is our very survival. With HIV/AIDS we need not wonder whether the enemy will follow us. The enemy is here now. But so is the army that can vanquish the foe. It is us. It is up to us. For if not us, who? If not now, when? If we summon the faith of our ancestors, the courage of our great grandparents, and the determination of our parents, we will march on until victory is won.", "Although the obesity rates among all African-Americans are alarming, as Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among African-American youth. More than 40 percent of African-American teenagers are overweight, and nearly 25 percent are obese.", "Earlier this year, my office in concert with the office of Congressman Towns and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, held a widely- attended issue forum entitled, ``Childhood Obesity: Factors Contributing to Its Disproportionate Prevalence in Low Income Communities.'' At this forum, a panel of professionals from the fields of medicine, academia, nutrition, and the food industry discussed the disturbing increasing rates of childhood obesity in minority and low-income communities, and the factors that are contributing to the prevalence in these communities.", "What we know is that African-American youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise. This combination has led to an epidemic of obesity, which directly contributes to numerous deadly or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including the following: hypertension; dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels); Type 2 diabetes; coronary heart disease; stroke; gallbladder disease; osteoarthritis; asthma, bronchitis, sleep apnea, and other respiratory problems; and cancer (breast, colon, and endometrial).", "When ethnicity and income are considered, the picture is even more troubling. African-American youngsters from low-income families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higher-income families. Since the mid-1970s, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CCDC), among African-American male adults aged 20-74 years the prevalence of obesity increased from 15.0 percent in 1980 survey to 32.9 percent in the 2004.", "There were also increases in overweight among children and teens. For children aged 2-5 years, the prevalence of overweight increased from 5.0 percent to 13.9 percent; for those aged 6-11 years, prevalence increased from 6.5 percent to 18.8 percent; and for those aged 12-19 years, prevalence increased from 5.0 percent to 17.4 percent.", "As the debate over how to address the rising childhood obesity epidemic continues, it is especially important to explore how attitudes, environmental factors, and public policies influence contribute to obesity among African-American males. Some of these contributing factors are environmental, others are cultural, still others are economic, and others still may be lack of education or information. But one thing is clear: we must find ways to remove them.", "The third and final health challenge confronting the African-American community, and African-American males in particular, involves the issue of gun violence and homicide. This must be a priority health issue for our community. Over 600,000 Americans are victimized in handgun crimes each year, and the African-American community is among the hardest hit.", "One week ago, on Monday, April 16, 2007, at Virginia Tech University, one of the nation's great land grant colleges, we witnessed senseless acts of violence on a scale unprecedented in our history. Neither the mind nor the heart can contemplate a cause that could lead a human being to inflict such injury and destruction on fellow human beings. The loss of life and innocence at Virginia Tech is a tragedy over which all Americans mourn and the thoughts and prayers of people of goodwill everywhere go out to the victims and their families. In the face of such overwhelming grief, I hope they can take comfort in the certain knowledge that unearned suffering is redemptive.", "Thirty-three persons died in the massacre at Virginia Tech. But there is a much less noticed, though no less devastating, massacre and loss of life going on in African-American communities across the country. Since 1978, on average, 33 young black males between the ages of 15 and 24 are murdered every 6 days. Three-quarters of these victims are killed by firearms.", "In 1997, firearm homicide was the number one cause of death for African-American men ages 15-34, as well as the leading cause of death for all African-Americans 15-24 years old. The firearm death rate for African-Americans was 2.6 times that of whites. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the firearms suicide rate amongst African-American youths aged 10-19 more than doubled over a 15 year period. Although African-Americans have had a historically lower rate of suicide than whites, the rate for African-Americans 15-19 has reached that of white youths aged 15-19.", "A young African-American male is 10 times more likely to be murdered than a young white male. The homicide rate among African-American men aged 15 to 24 rose by 66 percent from 1984 to 1987, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Ninety-five percent of this increase was due to firearm-related murders. For African-American males, aged 15 to 19, firearm homicides have increased 158 percent from 1985 to 1993. In 1998, 94 percent of the African-American murder victims were slain by African-American offenders.", "In 1997, African-American males accounted for 45 percent of all homicide victims, while they only account for 6 percent of the entire population. It is scandalous that a 15-year-old urban African-American male faces a probability of being murdered before reaching his 45th birthday that ranges from almost 8.5 percent in the District of Columbia to less than 2 percent in Brooklyn. By comparison, the probability of being murdered by age 45 is a mere three-tenths of 1 percent for all white males.", "Firearms have become the predominant method of suicide for African-Americans aged 10-19 years, accounting for over 66 percent of suicides. In Florida, for example, African-American males have an almost eight times greater chance of dying in a firearm-related homicide than white males. In addition, the firearm-related homicide death rate for African-American females is greater than white males and over four times greater than white females.", "As the tragedy this week at Virginia Tech University revealed, school shootings are sobering and tragic events that cause much concern for the safety of children. Homicides involving children and youth that are school related make up one percent of the total number of child and youth homicides in the United States. Most school associated violent deaths occur during transition times such as the start or end of the school day, during the lunch period, or the start of a semester.", "Nearly 50 percent of all homicide perpetrators give some type of prior warning signal such as a threat or suicide note. Among the students who commit a school-associated homicide, 20 percent were known to have been victims of bullying and 12 percent were known to have expressed suicidal thoughts or engage in suicidal behavior.", "My legislative agenda during the 110th Congress includes introducing legislation to assist local governments and school administrators in devising preventive measures to reduce school-associated violent deaths. In devising such preventive measures, at a minimum, we must focus on:", "Encouraging efforts to reduce crowding, increase supervision, and institute plans/policies to handle disputes during transition times that may reduce the likelihood of potential conflicts and injuries.", "Taking threats seriously and letting students know who and where to go when they learn of a threat to anyone at the school and encouraging parents, educators, and mentors to take an active role in helping troubled children and teens.", "Taking talk of suicide seriously and identifying risk factors for suicidal behavior when trying to prevent violence toward self and others.", "Developing prevention programs designed to help teachers and other school staff recognize and respond to incidences of bullying between students.", "Ensuring that each school has a security plan and that it is being enforced and that school staff are trained and prepared to implement and execute the plan.", "My legislative agenda during the 110th Congress also includes introducing sensible legislation to assist law enforcement departments, social service agencies, and school officials detect and deter gun violence.", "Again, thank you all for your commitment to working to find workable solutions to the heath and wellness challenges facing our communities. I look forward to working with you in the months ahead to achieve our mutual goals.", "Have a successful and inspiring conference."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/04/23/H3758_health-care-issues-affecting-minority-communities-/"}
