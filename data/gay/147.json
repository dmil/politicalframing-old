John S. Hamilton, Dr. Ogretta V. McNeil, Most Rev. Daniel P. Reilly, and Albert M. Toney III, dedicated themselves to fighting bias, bigotry and racism in America and making the nation a better place for all of us.', u"Mr. Hamilton put into action his belief that small, culturally diverse businesses make the difference in the economic viability of their communities. He has been a strong advocate for under-served populations, especially minority and women owned small businesses. Active with Centro Las Americas and the Business Inclusion Council, and the Martin Luther King Business Empowerment Center, he was named Massachusetts Financial Services Advocate of the Year (1999) by the US Small Business Administration. Mr. Hamilton was the driving force behind obtaining funding for the establishment of the Martin Luther King Business Empowerment Center. He was instrumental in Bay State Savings Bank sponsorship of the successful grant application for the renovation of the Odd Fellows Hall on Main Street, which will provide low income housing for families in Worcester. In 1995 and 1996, under Mr. Hamilton's leadership, Bay State Savings Bank was one of the top 5 SBA lenders to minority-owned businesses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Mr. Hamilton was recently appointed President of Medway Cooperative Savings Bank.", u"Dr. McNeil came to Worcester in 1956 to attend graduate school at Clark University; she never left and has made the City of Worcester her home. Dr. McNeil has served on the faculty of Assumption College, Anna Maria College, and the College of the Holy Cross. During the course of her 27-year career at the College of the Holy Cross, she served as Chairwoman of the Department of Psychology, Director of African American Studies, and Assistant Dean. Her election as the President of the New England Psychological Association symbolized her professional achievement. In 1998 Dr. McNeil was elected to the Worcester school committee where she has worked to foster equity of education for all students. Dr. McNeil's volunteer activities include serving as a board member for the Alliance for Education, the Age Center of Worcester, the EcoTarium, and a member of the Distribution Committee of the Health Foundation of Central Mass. She is also a board member of Greater Worcester Community Foundation, Family Services and the Worcester Art Museum.", u"Bishop Daniel Patrick Reilly, installed as the fourth Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester in December 1994, is a beloved leader. His efforts in Worcester resulted in the formation of the covenant with the New England Synod (Lutheran), the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester and Springfield. He was one of the essential leaders in the aftermath of the loss of six Worcester fire fighters in December of 1999. He studied for the priesthood at Our Lady of Providence Minors Seminary, Warwick, RI and ordained to the priesthood on May 30, 1953 after five years of philosophical and theological study at the Grand Seminaire in Saint Brieue, France. Following his ordination, Bishop Reilly served at SS. Peter &amp; Paul Cathedral Parish, Providence as an associate pastor. He also pursued graduate studies in Business Administration at Boston College and Harvard University. He served 22 years as a priest in the Diocese of Providence. In June 1975, Pope Paul VI named him Bishop of the Diocese of Norwich, CT, where he served until being named the Bishop of Worcester. Bishop Reilly has held many posts in the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB); he currently sits on the NCCB's Committee on Pastoral Practices. He rendered great support and assistance to Haiti and to India and their people. Currently he is a member of the boards of trustees at The Catholic Near East Welfare Association, Assumption College, and Saint Vincent Hospital. He holds Honorary doctoral degrees from Anna Maria College, Assumption College, and the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester.", u"Mr. Al Toney's life work is the elimination of homophobia and racism. As a self-identified gay African American male, he has experienced homophobia and racism first hand. A former Worcester Police Officer, Mr. Toney has served in leadership position for the Gay Officers Action League of New England, the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Central Mass., and the City of Worcester Human Rights Commission. In 1997, he founded the Safe Homes of Central Massachusetts, an organization that provides mentoring programs, consulting services for alternative foster parenting programs, and a drop in recreation and resource center. Beginning as a group of concerned citizens, with Mr. Toney's leadership this program was recently adopted as a formal program of The Bridge of Central Massachusetts. As early as 1984 when he started college with a major in urban studies, he was concerned with creating safe, inclusive communities for all people. His focus was initially directed to enforcement through course work in Criminal Justice and service as a police officer (March 1987-April 1995). After the tragic death of his life partner, Mr. Toney's energies shifted to a new focus, homophobia. Mr. Toney has worked as a consultant and program director for AIDS Project Worcester, AIDS Action Committee (Boston), Healthy Boston Coalition for GLBT Youth, Massachusetts Prevention Center, Massachusetts Department of Education, and Massachusetts Department of Social Services. He served as member of the City of Worcester Human Rights Commission from 1997-2000. He is currently a member of the Arts Worcester Board of Directors. Mr. Toney, his partner, and his daughter are currently working on a book for children, which truly reflects all aspects of diversity."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/11/08/E2036-2_leaders-taking-action-for-inclusion/'}
