This year, the congregation will be celebrating its 150th year anniversary. As the members gather together to celebrate, I ask all my colleagues to join with me in saluting this commendable achievement.", "B'nai Israel's humble beginning can be traced back to the ``Gold Rush'' days of 1849, when shop owners and crafts people gathered to celebrate the High Holy Days in Old Sacramento. Among these people was Moses Hyman, who invited fellow Jews into his Front Street home. Later, Hyman became known as both a pioneer of California Judaism and the father of Temple B'nai Israel.", "A fire swept through Sacramento just two months after Hyman helped dedicate the congregation's first synagogue in 1852. The fire destroyed the chapel as well as 85 percent of the city. However, Congregation B'nai Israel persevered. In 1858, the congregation purchased another place of worship from the Methodist Episcopalian group, which had been built on the same property as the congregation's first chapel. Unfortunately, nature continued to conspire against B'nai Israel. After another fire and floods that destroyed the synagogue, the congregation established its third permanent home in a former concert hall for the First Presbyterian Church in Sacramento.", "Here, B'nai Israel continued to grow and thrive for decades until the split of Orthodox and Reformed Jews in the early twentieth century. This split, however, only served to strengthen the congregation. Touting itself as a congregation of ``Reformed Israelites,'' Congregation B'nai Israel had grown in size to over 107 families. Their new home, on Fifteenth Street in Sacramento, served as B'nai Israel's religious home for over 30 years.", "In an effort to expand the congregation, President Dalton Feinstein successfully promoted the idea of relocating to the present temple site at 3600 Riverside Boulevard. To make this dream a reality, a major fund-raising campaign was successfully launched. The new temple was finally dedicated in 1954, thanks to the dedication of volunteers who raised money and found others to donate materials. An education wing, named after Buddy Kandel, was added in the early 1960's.", "Throughout the years, the congregation has been involved in several community services and causes. Such involvement includes demonstrations against pogroms after World War I, organizing institutes for Christian clergy members to improve Judeo-Christian understanding, and conducting services at Folsom State Prison.", "Rabbi Lester Frazi, who took over the pulpit in January 1974 and remained over 20 years, continued the B'nai Israel tradition of service to the greater Sacramento area. In addition to serving as president of the Interfaith Service Bureau, his areas of focus included helping pregnant teenagers, feeding the hungry, and supporting the gay and lesbian community.", "In 1995, Rabbi Brad Bloom was installed as Rabbi Frazi's replacement. Under this leadership, the congregation has been involved in several areas, including Shabbat food deliveries to people with AIDS, Mitzvah Day, children's book collections, High Holy Day food donations to the Sacramento Food Basket, and more.", "On June 18, 1999, arson fires were set at B'nai Israel, Kenesset Israel Torah Center, and Beth Shalom. Despite this horrifying act, the congregation has remained strong. In addition, support from the community during this time of trial has been overwhelming. On June 21 at the Sacramento Community Center, over 4,000 people joined in a Unity Rally in a show of solidarity. At the rally, patrons were greeted with signs bearing the sentiment, ``We are strong. We are proud. We are together.'' Despite its many tragedies in its existence, B'nai Israel has grown stronger and stronger.", "Mr. Speaker, as the members of the B'nai Israel Congregation gather to celebrate their 150th anniversary, I am honored to pay tribute to one of Sacramento's most exceptional organizations. Concerning their trials, the perseverance and dedication of this congregation are particularly incredible. I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in wishing B'nai Israel continued success in all its future endeavors."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/10/18/E2112-2_tribute-to-the-bnai-israel-congregation-of-sacrame/"}
