He was born on April 14, 1926, in a time when the day after his birthday, Tax Day, was just another day of the month. This weekend, General Hall was the guest of honor at the home of Governor Bill Owens celebrating his 75th birthday and 30th anniversary with his gracious wife, Georgann.', u"Many of us have read adventure novels, or vicariously experienced adventure in the movies or on television, but General Hall is a real life hero. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1943 during World War II and served as a B-17 Gunner at only 17 years of age. He lost one brother at the ``Battle of the Bulge'' and another brother lost a leg. He served on Tinian Island in the Marianas where the Enola Gay was launched to bomb Hiroshima ultimately leading to the end of the war. Yet, his service to his country did not end there.", u"For a time he attempted to exercise his adventurous acumen on a gold mine in Mexico and after, loosing a plane and risking his life protecting the claim, walked away in search of other ventures. He worked in Hollywood as a consultant for the military movie classic ``Twelve O'clock High.'' Around that same time, General Hall was awarded a direct commission in the USAF in 1948 and distinguished himself as an expert in jumping out of perfectly good airplanes. He was the key developer of the parachuting program at the USAF Academy and has participated in over 1,200 jumps.", u"There is an Internet web site in his honor where Kevin Coyne, the publisher of the Ejection site writes: ``In late 1965, Jim Hall a professional parachute safety instructor and Major in the Air Force Reserve volunteered to act as the human guinea pig for the 0-0 seat package.'' He is still the only human being ever to participate in such a test. His comment after being launched by a rocket 400 feet into the air into a small lake, ``I've been kicked in the ass harder than that.'' Jim Hall is the epitome of the ``right stuff.''", u"Jim was a close friend of Steve Ritchie, the Air Force's first aerial Ace of Viet Nam and is an active proponent of continued use of Buckley field, General Hall was added, in 1985, to the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame. He has been active in Colorado politics helping to create the Colorado Leadership Program. He worked to elect Jack Swigert to the 6th Congressional district in 1982 and ultimately worked with the Colorado State Legislature to place the very popular statue of Swigert, right here in our nation's Capitol.", u"General Jim Hall is the Arapahoe County District II Captain to the county Grand Old Party, he is the namesake of the Aurora Republican Forum's ``General Jim Hall Award.'' He is the Military Advisor to Gov. Owens and the Governor's Community Relations Advisor for the Asian Community and I am honored to include him on my District Military Academy Selection Board and District Military Veterans' Committee.", u"It is my honor, and pleasure to recognize this outstanding constituent and distinguished American Service Man, here in the Nation's Capitol."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/04/24/E590-4_honoring-general-james-c-hall/'}
