It is in fact somewhat hypocritical that while there seems to be a lot of care for the material aspects of freedom, there doesn't seem to be as much concern that I hear voiced for the equally, if not more important, personal aspects of freedom.", "Truly, each individual is more important than the sum of their assets or a little entry on a ledger book. That might be a part of who you are--a very small part--but that's how you put food on the table and how you live, but there's a lot more to everybody. And when we as Progressives are talking about freedom, we're talking about the rest of the realm of our lives; those important everyday decisions in how you live.", "And no, government shouldn't be telling people who to marry or whether or not to end a pregnancy or whether or not to use a certain kind of research that could save lives. No one is forced to engage in that research; no one is forced to even terminate a pregnancy; no one is forced to marry a gay person. But the question is: Should you have the right to do it if you wanted? And I think as Progressives, our answer is an unabashed yes."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/05/14/H5640-3_the-progressive-message-from-the-progressive-caucu/"}
