It began as a block party on 20th St, between R and S Streets, NW. Six years later, in 1981, the annual Pride Parade became part of the festivities. Now Capital Pride consists of more than 10 days of events organized by the Capital Pride Planning Committee and dozens of local community partners.", u"This year's Capital Pride theme, ``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet,'' both reflects Capital Pride's past and anticipates its future.", u"Capital Pride's producer, the Capital Pride Alliance, Inc., predicts an attendance of 250,000, making Capital Pride one of the largest GLBT festivals in the United States.", u"This year Capital Pride culminates with what the Washington City Paper has declared D.C.'s Best Parade for three years running, the Capital Pride Parade, on June 12, and ``The Main Event,'' a street fair on Pennsylvania Avenue in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol, on June 13.", u'I have marched in Pride parades since coming to Congress to emphasize universal human rights and the importance of enacting federal legislation to secure those rights for the GLBT community. Congress has much work to do. We must pass the Family Leave Insurance Act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, the Respect for Marriage Act, the Safe Schools Improvement Act, the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act, the Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act, the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act, the Uniting American Families Act, and the Responsible Education About Life Act.', u"This year our nation's capital joined Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in extending equal marriage rights to its GLBT residents.", u'I ask the House to join me in welcoming those who are attending the 35th Annual Capital Pride.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/05/12/E825-2_honoring-the-35th-annual-capital-pride/'}
