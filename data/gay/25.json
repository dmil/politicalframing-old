After taking over his father's local automobile dealership in 1947, he eventually expanded the business to encompass thirteen locations throughout Maine. He was a true pioneer in his field and was never afraid to take a risk to help the business community. He was the first local car dealer to use television ads in the 1960s and employ a board of directors. He was a tireless advocate of economic development in Maine, even offering advice to competitors.", u'In addition, Shep is remembered for his contributions to the greater community. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he championed educational progress, donating generous amounts to both Bowdoin and Bates Colleges and the George Mitchell Scholarship fund. He sat on the law and business school boards of the University of Southern Maine, the board of the Muskie School of Public Service and the Maine Community College Board.', u"His life-long commitment to gender equality and civil rights was also remarkable. He was an active member of the Maine branch of the NAACP and served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union, later receiving the Roger Baldwin Award, the ACLU's higher honor. Shep supported gay rights legislation well before the passage of Maine's non-discrimination law.", u"An advisor, friend and tireless fund-raiser for Senator George Mitchell, the late Justice Frank Coffin and the late Edmund Muskie, Shep's political activism was notable both locally and nationally. He is fondly remembered by his friends, family and colleagues, and his contributions to the State of Maine will not soon be forgotten.", u'Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring Shepard Lee for his life of dedication and service to his community and his country.
