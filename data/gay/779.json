This stamp was part of a set of four folk hero stamps recently issued by the U.S. Postal Service also honoring Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, and the Mighty Casey. The Postal Service had initially only planned to announce the stamp in Pittsburgh and issue it in Anaheim, CA, at an annual show. However, I am proud to have been part of an effort launched by my colleague, Congressman Nick Rahall, and the residents of Talcott to ensure that this folk legend and this great town which gave him birth were honored with a personalized unveiling and stamp cancellation ceremony.', u"In the latter part of 1995, the townspeople of Talcott were disappointed to learn that the U.S. Postal Service announced in Pittsburgh, PA, instead of West Virginia, the design of a 1996 stamp honoring John Henry. I asked for the rationale behind this decision and was advised by the Postal Service that this site was selected because of the city's linkage to railroad yards. While I could easily understand such a ``thematic'' or ``geographical'' approach--a Steel-Driving Man being recognized in the ``Steel City''--virtually all of the residents of my State strongly believed that John Henry's legend is based on the classic tale of his competition against the mechanical steam drill at Big Bend Mountain in Talcott. So it only would make sense for West Virginians to be able to celebrate the legend of John Henry and the issuance of his stamp with an appropriate ceremony of their own.", u'I asked the Postmaster General to plan a special ceremony in West Virginia for the John Henry stamp. I also urged him to organize a specific event in Talcott related to the 1996 John Henry stamp as the home of this folk legend.', u"The fact that West Virginia is the true home of the John Henry legend made it a natural choice for a special recognition ceremony to celebrate the emergence of this new stamp. John Henry's fame has fascinated millions of people throughout the world and continues to interest new generations to this day. He is a symbol of the importance of human determination and skill, which is increasingly meaningful given the rise of technology in today's culture. His significance in representing human labor and a tireless work ethic also play a compelling role in West Virginia's history. But overall, to emphasize why this issue is so important, it is necessary to understand the legend and his link to West Virginia. Let me share with you a little of the history.", u'The details of the John Henry folklore sprang from the construction of the Big Bend Tunnel on the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad in Talcott in 1873. Various stories led to the legend of John Henry; but, unfortunately, no documentation exists because earlier C&amp;O Railroad records were destroyed in a fire in 1880. Local historians do know that from 1870 to 1872, a gang of hand-drillers working from the railroad actually carved out rock from the Big Bend Mountain for the railroad. This tunnel stands as proof today that the legend of John Henry has roots in reality, and a statue of this folk hero tops this tunnel.', u"John Henry was assumed to be an African-American slave who worked on the team of Big Bend Tunnel drillers. Famed Appalachia folklore historian Dr. James Gay Jones of Glenville, WV, noted in his 1979 book, ``Haunted Valley, and More Folk Tales of Appalachia,'' that of all the railroad workers in the area of the time, a man known as John Henry was held in the highest esteem because of his prowess, immense size, brute strength, and great labor ethic. John Henry ``became known as a driver of steel,'' that is, he used these great sledgehammers to drive steel rods deep into red shale rock walls. The rods were then removed, explosives were placed in them, and portions of the wall were removed blast by blast.", u'When a new steam power drill, the Burleigh, was brought to the Big Bend Tunnel for testing purposes, legend has it that John Henry agreed to a wager to see if he could drive more steel and clear more tunnel than the machine. A contest was held, and the legend is that John Henry drove a deeper hole than the machine. It is the contest in the mountains of West Virginia that created the legend and made the point that man can triumph in the competition against machine.', u"There is some controversy over how and when John Henry died. Some claim that he died because of the contest when a blood vessel burst in his head. Others say he was killed in a rock fall in the Big Bend Tunnel. Regardless of the circumstance, his legend was born and nurtured by West Virginia to share with the world, and it lives on today. It is a bit of West Virginia's contribution to basic folklore which has enriched our Nation's culture and heritage, and West Virginians like me are very proud to take an active part in recognizing and preserving this heritage.
