Callahan, Jr., who has represented Virginia's 34th District in the Virginia General Assembly for nearly 4 decades. I want to take this opportunity to salute Vince for his dedication to a lifetime of public service representing those in the McLean area of Fairfax County.", u"A native of Washington, D.C., and McLean resident since 1960, Vince holds a B.S. degree from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and by profession is an editor, publisher, and author. He served as a Marine in the Korean War from 1950-52 and later as a reserve officer in the U.S. Coast Guard.", u'Elected to the House of Delegates in 1967, Vince is the longest serving Republican in the Virginia General Assembly and dean of the Northern Virginia Delegation. As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Vince can point to a long list of legislative achievements in service to the Commonwealth of Virginia. He will be sorely missed. In honor of his work for higher education, Vince was awarded an Honorary Degree in the Humane Letters from the Northern Virginia Community College and the Lord Botetourt Award from the College of William and Mary. I have inserted for The Record a recent Sun Gazette article which details his unparalleled career.', u'Perhaps more important than the well deserved awards and recognitions Vince has accrued over the years is the way he conducts himself. He is a man of his convictions, and of the highest moral character, a true Virginia gentleman, family man, and loyal friend. Vince and his wife Yvonne have eight children and 19 grandchildren between them and I suspect that Vince is looking forward to spending more time with family as he retires. I ask that my colleagues in the House rise today and join with me in recognizing the outstanding public service career of Vincent F. Callahan, Jr.', u"Forty years is enough: Del. Vincent Callahan (R-34th), a McLean resident who is the second-longest serving member of the Virginia House of Delegates, announced March 5 that he would not seek reelection in November. ``You get to a certain stage in life where you've done what you want to do,'' he said. ``It gets old after a while.'' Callahan, 75, entered politics early in life. After being defeated in a 1965 bid for lieutenant governor, he first was elected to the House of Delegates in 1967. He was one of only 14 Republicans in that body then, versus 86 Democrats. Unlike today, when legislators have offices and a professional staff to help them, delegates then operated out of hotel rooms or their desks in the House of Delegates during General Assembly sessions, he said. Callahan credited former House of Delegates Speaker John Warren Cooke (D-Mathews) for teaching him proper legislative decorum. ``He was born in 1915 and his father was an officer in the Confederate Army'' who was in his 70s when Cooke was born, Callahan said. ``You talk about somebody from the old school. He was the epitome of a Virginia gentleman.'' Republicans achieved parity in the House of Delegates in 1998 and Callahan was named co-chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. When Republicans became the majority in 2000, he became the committee's sole chairman. Callahan, who lost a bid for Congress in 1976, has seen Virginia's biennial budget grow from $3 billion when he first joined the General Assembly to $75 billion today. Gov. Kaine called Callahan on Monday to congratulate him on the latest budget, which passed unanimously. Callahan said his key accomplishments in office include strongly supporting George Mason University, Northern Virginia Community College and other higher-education institutions; securing $500 million to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay; and bolstering mental-health services around the state. He's also ``tilted at a few windmills,'' championing a higher minimum wage and a ban on smoking in public places. These bills have been defeated so far but likely will pass in the near future, he predicted. Virginia has tremendous colleges, enjoys a AAA bond rating and consistently is ranked one of the best-managed states in the nation, he said. Only Del. Lacey Putney (I-Bedford), who has served since 1962, has spent longer than Callahan in the House of Delegates. Callahan's tenure has not always been smooth. Legislators have had to go into special sessions several times in recent years because of budget disagreements. And in 1998, he apologized after making remarks that some female legislators found offensive. ``They jumped on me and I haven't done it since,'' he said. ``It wasn't meant to be demeaning to women.'' Democrats already were actively targeting Callahan's seat, with candidates Margi Vanderhye and Rip Sullivan contending for the nomination in the June primary. Callahan has about $85,000 in unspent campaign moneys and will use them to pay office expenses for the remainder of his term. Leftover funds will be given to other political campaigns or donated to charity, he said. The 34th District always has been a swing district and has been represented for many years by a Democratic state senator, Callahan said. The district's voters sided with U.S. Senate candidate James Webb (D) during his victorious campaign in November 2006, but also re-elected longtime U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-10th), he said. A Republican candidate seeking the district's seat must take a moderate approach on issues, Callahan said. ``Moderation is the essence of conservatism,'' he said. ``I think there's two sides to every issue. You don't do immigrant or gay bashing to get headlines. You have to look at the whole picture.'' Callahan will spend the rest of his term overseeing 400th-anniversary celebrations of the Jamestown Colony's founding. He will be among dignitaries who will greet Queen Elizabeth II on May 3 when she visits Richmond and addresses a joint General Assembly session. Callahan was born in Washington, D.C., and served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War. He also served in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve from 1959 to 1963, retiring as a lieutenant. Callahan has been a staple of Veterans Day celebrations at McLean High School, where he traditionally recites from memory John McCrae's World War I poem, ``In Flanders Fields.'' Fairfax County Supervisor Joan DuBois (R-Dranesville) credited Callahan with championing Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, trails in Great Falls, sound barriers along Interstate 495 in McLean and the status of Georgetown Pike as a Scenic Byway. ``He was a gentleman of the `old school' who knew that partisanship had no place in efforts to improve his community,'' DuBois said in a statement released Monday. ``He will be greatly missed by many of us who knew him as a go-to leader in the General Assembly for longer than I have lived in Northern Virginia.'' Vienna Town Council member Michael Polychrones said Callahan's departure will mark the end of an era in state politics and a loss for Northern Virginia. ``It will be a big blow to the area,'' Polychrones said. ``Vince has definitely done a yeoman's job over the years.''"], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/05/14/E1035-3_honoring-state-delegate-vincent-f-callahan-jr/'}
