Since 1985, the Pride Foundation, through creation and administration of a vibrant lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) charitable legacy, has helped to unify and to strengthen the Northwest LGBT and allied communities.", "In 1985, nonprofit organizations serving the needs of the LGBT community were rare. Those that did exist struggled for financial stability while also facing daunting challenges, not the least of which was the emergence of HIV/AIDS. At that time, no scholarships existed to help LGBT students pursue higher education. To address these challenges, a small group of concerned citizens founded the LGBT community's own philanthropic organization. The Pride Foundation created an endowment that would be prudently managed and professionally administered--a place where the LGBT community and its supporters could confidently contribute knowing full well that their donations would not only be used in accordance with the donor's wishes, but would also leave an enduring legacy for future generations.", "In 1987, the Pride Foundation awarded its first organization grants, totaling $7,654. Today, the Foundation grants hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. In 1993, the Pride Foundation started its scholarship program, giving $3,680 the first year. Since then, the program has become one of the nation's largest LGBT scholarship funds. To date, the Pride Foundation has raised and invested more than $8 million in hundreds of nonprofit organizations and individual students. In recent years, the Pride Foundation has broadened its reach beyond Seattle to the entire State of Washington as well as to Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon.", "The Pride Foundation has enriched tens of thousands of lives, and has touched those who give and those who receive. It has sustained countless students, strengthened many valued non-profit organizations, and helped to improve the quality of life in the Pacific Northwest. Today, I rise to offer my thanks and congratulations to the Pride Foundation for 25 years of inspiring work and a legacy that will impact generations to come."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/09/22/E1708_celebrating-the-25th-anniversary-of-the-pride-foun/"}
