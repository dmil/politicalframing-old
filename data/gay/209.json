Since the establishment of the Peace Corps by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, more than 195,000 U.S. Citizens have served their country in the cause of peace by living and working in 139 countries throughout the world. Each Volunteer sent out into the field represents another opportunity to dispel myths about the United States, to help people of interested countries meet their need for trained men and women, and to create lasting bonds of friendship with host country citizens. Volunteers are currently providing expertise and development assistance to 76 countries and are working to find common ways to address global challenges. These Volunteers share their time and talent serving as teachers, business advisors, information technology consultants, agriculture and environmental specialists, and health and HIV/AIDS educators. The Peace Corps has become an enduring symbol of our nation's commitment to encourage progress, create opportunity, and expand development at the grass-roots level in the developing world.", u"I would like to commend our proud nation's Peace Corps volunteers for their service, particularly those 58 men and women of the Eleventh Congressional District of Virginia who are currently serving as volunteers: Lauryn Alleva, Alfred Baldwin, Anne Berwick, Albert Bond, Erica Brouillette, Casey Burke, Daniel Cassiday, Alexander Chidakel, Kelly Connors, Rhiannon Cooper, David Coscia, Eric Crowder, Kevin Dansereau, Ryan Dickriede, David Doane, Scott Estep, Brian Fries, Evan Gay, Jeffrey Gilleo, Nathan Graham, Nathan Hernandez, Michaela Hoffman, Thomas Holian, Rachel Kavanagh, Matthew Keenan, Dianne Kim, Shinhee Kim, Melissa Ko, Rachel Kramer, Phuong-Thuy Le, Hye Lee, Laara Manier, Katherine Mariska, Paul Mastin, Alona Mays, Kelly McCormack, Russell McDaniel, John McGrath, Jonathan Mellor, Theresa Milstein, Matthew Mozingo, Karine Nankam, Trevor Perrier, Jessica Pic, Jennifer Polasek, Mathis Pollock, Jonathan Seiden, Hanna Simering, Jonathan Styron, Mary Thur, Rachel Vanderburg, Amy Vaughters, Christine Wahle, Joshua Wayland, Jessica West, Clemens Weygandt, Courtney Wong, and Dale Yurovich. I consider it a great honor to represent these noble men and women, who travel great distances and make great sacrifices to help reaffirm our country's commitment to helping people help themselves throughout the world.", u'Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me today to acknowledge the thousands of Americans who serve and have served as Peace Corps Volunteers. They are a great credit to our country, and we should applaud them.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/02/25/E391_national-peace-corps-week/'}
