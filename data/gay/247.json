On Sunday, June 25, Bruce is being honored at the ninth GLBT Community Tribute Banquet. Upon learning of this award, Bruce stated that receiving the community tribute this year is humbling and a wonderful honor, and at the banquet Bruce will urge people to get engaged and give back to the community.', u'No stranger to being honored, Bruce Abrams has received numerous awards in the past, such as the Douglas Scott Political Action Award and the Liberty Award presented by the Lambda Legal Defense Fund.', u'Throughout his 20 years of activism, Bruce has used his education and influence to promote positive change and garner needed funds for the whole community. He has emphasized the importance of all people being involved in their neighborhoods and communities.', u'The Bruce M. Abrams Lending Library at the center is a direct result of what I call progressive philanthropy. Bruce not only helped to start this community resource, he ensured that the library would have a group of supporters who would be able to keep it going throughout the years. Today the library houses more than 2,000 volumes.', u"His resume of volunteer service includes a long list of current and past board memberships, including the San Diego Democratic Club, San Diego Foundation for Change, Equality California, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Since last year, Bruce has served as a city commissioner on San Diego's Human Relations Commission.", u"No novice to the political arena, Bruce first cut his teeth working on the gubernatorial campaign of Mayor Tom Bradley. Frequently, Bruce holds political receptions, charity benefits and galas at his beautifully decorated home. As I personally know, these events are not mere fund-raisers, but elegant gatherings which bring people together for real communication. Everybody loves the evenings at Bruce Abrams' home.", u"When not raising the moral consciousness of the world, Bruce works as a probate and planning attorney. He has a B.A. from the University of Oregon and a J.D. from the Thomas Jefferson School of Law. He truly is the ``attorney for the community.'' Bruce, we love you."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/21/H4381-3_honoring-bruce-michael-abrams/'}
