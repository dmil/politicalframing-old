Mellon Auditorium, in Washington, DC. I had the opportunity of attending this worthy and inspirational event, and I have had the honor of serving as chairman of the NELA gala in the past. This worthy and inspirational annual event has gained wide recognition during the past few years in Congress, the corporate community, educational institutions, and others in the philanthropic community throughout the Nation for its promotion of educational excellence and professional achievement. I commend the SIF for the encouragement it provides to some of our Nation's most outstanding young scholars and future leaders.", "At this year's event, the SIF presented scholarships to the winners of the 1996 National Leadership Grant Competition, an annual merit-based national scholarship competition. In addition, the SIF presented the 1996 NELA's to Northwest Airlines Corp. Cochairman Alfred Checchi and Pennsylvania State University football coach Joseph V. Paterno. In selecting Messrs. Checchi and Paterno for this honor and in awarding a merit-based academic scholarship in each of their names, the SIF has recognized two of the most outstanding role models in the Italian-American community.", "The lives of these two men of enormous achievement and strong character serve as reminders of why our forebears traveled to this country and why today's immigrants are so eager to make their homes in our great country, where opportunity abounds for those willing to learn and work hard. The achievements of these two men speak highly of the importance of strong family support, educational achievement, and professional integrity. These are values on which all of us agree, regardless of our racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds. These common values, aptly expressed through the NELA gala, are what bind us as Americans. Most appropriately, the scholarships that the SIF awarded in the names of Mr. Checchi and Mr. Paterno will support the dreams and aspirations of outstanding young students. There is no more important work for us to perform, no greater gift we can give than to support our youth.", "The long and distinguished record of generous support for education earned by the SIF and its parent organization, the Order Sons of Italy in America, should be recognized and praised. These generous contributions in support of the future of our Nation are made largely by the modest and heartfelt donations of the hundreds of thousands of OSIA members throughout our United States. During the past three decades, OSIA and the SIF have distributed more than $21 million in academic scholarships. The leaders and members of OSIA and the SIF have set an excellent example for other nonprofit and fraternal organizations in their unselfish support of the young people of our Nation.", "I commend Mr. Paul S. Polo, national president of OSIA and chairman of the SIF; Mr. Valentino Ciullo, president of the SIF; Ms. Jo-Anne Gauger, chairwoman of OSIA's National Education Committee; Mr. Joseph E. Antonini, 1996 NELA gala chairman; and Dr. Philip R. Piccigallo, national executive director of the OSIA and the SIF, for their leadership roles in the 1996 NELA gala and the National Leadership Grant Competition.", "Listed below are the names of the 12 winners of the 1996 National Leadership Grant Competition. These young men and women represent our Nation's highest level of academic achievement and leadership potential. I offer congratulations and heartfelt wishes for future success to: Mr. Michael Sollazzo, Henry Salvatori Scholarship; Mr. Andrea Mazzariello, Alfred Checchi Scholarship; Mr. Brian Iammartino, Joseph V. Paterno Scholarship; Ms. Jillian Catalanotti, Dr. Vincenzo Sellaro Scholarship; Mr. Todd Builione, Carlone Family/Peter B. Gay Scholarship; Mr. Ben Jamieson, Hon. Frank J.
