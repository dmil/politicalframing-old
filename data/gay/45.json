We must always be mindful that our Nation's history is a chronicle of the blending of many formerly separate cultures and languages, ideas and lifestyles, into one American identity that celebrates its diversity. I look forward to a day when we can all be tolerant.", "The National Day of Silence recognizes that diversity is a cornerstone of American democracy--that all people are individuals and have a right to be treated with dignity and respect.", "I look forward to a time where anti-GLBT harassment is no longer a problem in our schools. But until that happens, I am pleased to celebrate those students who recognize and appreciate the diversity of their classmates. I urge my colleagues to do the same and support H. Con. Res. 328."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/04/23/H2555-8_national-day-of-silence/"}
