This legislation would authorize the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to construct the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum Dulles Center at Washington Dulles International Airport. The legislation clearly states that no appropriated funds may be used to pay any expense of the construction of the center. Funds for the construction will be privately raised and in fact this legislation permits the Smithsonian to move forward with a fundraising drive.", "In 1983, the Smithsonian Board of Regents first approved the National Air and Space Museum plan to expand at Washington Dulles International Airport. In 1993, after 10 years of hard work by the Smithsonian Institution, the Virginia congressional delegation, five Virginia Governors, and many local officials, Congress passed and the President signed legislation authorizing the Smithsonian Institution to plan and design the National Air and Space Museum Extension at Washington Dulles International Airport.", "This legislation would serve to further the objectives of the National Museum Amendments Act of 1965 which directs the National Air and Space Museum to ``collect, preserve, and display aeronautical and space flight equipment of historical interest and significance.''", "I believe that it is accurate to state that the National Air and Space Museum now holds the most impressive and significant collection of air and spacecraft in the world. However, due to the limited exhibition space in The Mall building coupled with the size and weight of many of the artifacts, only 20 percent of the museum's collection is on display. Therefore, such significant air and spacecraft as the Boeing 367-80, the Saturn V launch vehicle, the Boeing Flying Fortress, the B-29 Enola Gay and the space orbiter Enterprise cannot be displayed and enjoyed by the nearly 10 million visitors the museum receives each year. In addition, the museum's space limitations inhibit the interpretation of aerospace technology's significant contribution to America and the possibilities which it holds for the future.", "The Air and Space Museum Dulles Center will allow approximately 65 percent of the Smithsonian's air and spacecraft collection to be on display. The center will also allow visitors to view the restoration operations and see first-hand how historic air and spacecraft are preserved.", " By Mr. BIDEN:", "S. 1996.
