This is the centerpiece of our democracy, the election of a President.', u"The President has his own powers according to the Constitution, but also the power of appointment of the third branch of government, the Supreme Court. So a great deal is at stake in this election: the presidency and the President's appointments to the court.", u"If the next President appoints just one or two more justices to the court, and they do not support some of our basic fundamental rights, fundamental rights could be abolished or curtailed. The Supreme Court's decisions affect all aspect of our lives including basic civil rights and day-to-day pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness.", u'It is significant to note, I think, that no Supreme Court justice has retired in 6 years, the longest interval without a new appointment in 177 years. In the last 50 years, every President except one has appointed at least one justice, and 8 of the last 10 Presidents have appointed 2 justices. Court watchers expect several justices to retire soon, and, thus, the next President is likely to appoint several justices to fill these vacancies.', u'I mention this, Mr. Speaker, because many have asked, well, how do these elections affect young people in our country? Well, the election of the President affects them very directly in the decisions that that President will make but also very directly in terms of his power of appointment of the court, the Supreme Court, and indeed many, many scores of Federal Court justices.', u'As I have said, the Supreme Court makes many decisions that fundamentally affect and change our lives, and so young people should be very interested in these judges, this President, and the decisions that this court will make because it will have an impact for generations to come.', u"Soon the court will be deciding cases governing civil rights, workers' rights, reproductive freedom, voting rights, and campaign finance reform. The court will decide Congress' authority to apply Federal laws protecting individuals and our environment to the States, including the Americans with Disabilities Act. The court will address electoral redistricting and minority voting rights, free speech, criminal cases involving unreasonable search and seizure, and the scope of Federal regulations, really protections and safeguards, for all Americans.", u"How do the courts' decisions on these issues affect our lives? For women, the court has an impact on reproductive freedom. For workers, the court affects the ability to sue employers who violate employees' civil rights. Again, for women, the court affects access to family planning clinics and access to safe and appropriate medical care. For gay and lesbian Americans, the court affects civil rights protections and equal opportunity. For people with disabilities, the court affects protections in the Americans with Disabilities Act.", u'I asked one volunteer in a political campaign why she was volunteering, and she said I have looked around, studied the issues, and I realize that people in politics make decisions about the air I breathe and the water I drink. The same applies to the Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker. The court affects the air we breathe and the water we drink by determining the legality of the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. This volunteer went on to say, so I guess I should be interested in politics, at least for as long as I drink water and I breathe air.', u'Young people should be, and we should all be interested in the court and the person who will name justices to that court for at least as long as we breathe air and drink water.', u"The two issues that I would like to just focus on, in the interest of time, because I know the hour is late, are a woman's right to choose and the issue of the protection of our environment and how those issues will be affected by the court. The next President will likely appoint two, perhaps three Supreme Court justices, enough to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow States to enact severe and sweeping restrictions on women's reproductive rights. If the anti-choice majority maintains its control over the Senate, the Supreme Court nominations of an anti-choice President are likely to be quickly confirmed.", u"Governor George Bush is an anti-choice governor with a record to prove it. In 1999 alone, Governor Bush, along with Michigan's Governor Engler signed more anti-choice provisions into law than any other governor in the U.S. Governor Bush has said he believes Roe v. Wade went too far and has characterized the 1973 ruling as a reach. Governor Bush has also said that Justice Antonin Scalia, arguably the most ardent opponent of abortion on the Supreme Court, would be his model justice.", u"Governor Bush wants to end legal reproductive freedom in the U.S. Al Gore would protect a woman's right to choose. The choice is clear: Pro-choice Americans must understand that Governor Bush will use the power of the Presidency to end legal reproductive choice and take away a woman's right to choose.", u"In terms of the environment, moving on to that because I know that is an issue that young people are interested in as well, I mentioned that Governor Bush has said that his model justice was Justice Scalia. Sadly, Justice Scalia's environmental philosophy is just as dismal as some of the other issues that I mentioned here. Legal scholars who have studied the Supreme Court have found that Justice Scalia sided against the environment more than any other person in the history of the court.", u"How bad is his record? Eighty-seven percent of the time an environmental case came before the Supreme Court Justice Scalia decided against the environment. In Justice Scalia's world, citizens would not be allowed to stop pollution just because a company is poisoning their backyards. In a case decided earlier this year, a factory had dumped toxic mercury into a nearby river 489 times. How would you like that, Mr. Speaker, in your backyard? But even though the factory poisoned the river nearly 500 times, the Justice felt that the court was making it far too easy to halt an environmental crime.", u'So when we come to issues that young people are interested in, such as protecting the environment, this environment that we have only on loan because it belongs to them, it is their future, we must protect it in every way that we can. We can do that by our own personal behavior; through conservation; by the people we elect to office to make decisions about the environment; by the President of the United States, who leads the country in protecting our environment and the justices that he will appoint to the court who will make decisions about the air we breathe and the water we drink. For as long as we breathe air and drink water, Mr. Speaker, we should be very interested in those decisions.', u"Again, on the issue of a woman's right to choose, which I think is a matter that is at risk, we are at a crossroads and one that will be very much affected by the outcome of the election on November 7.", u"In the interest of time, I will not go into all the other issues, Mr. Speaker, except to say that November 7 is an important day, a day when we will be choosing not only a President but that President's appointees. There is a great deal at stake for young people. I hope they will pay attention to the election and its ramifications."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/10/19/H10463-5_future-justices-of-the-supreme-court/'}
