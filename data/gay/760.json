The tireless work of these students stands as a testament to the ability of youth to lay the foundation for long lasting peace in our schools and communities. The 10th Congressional District Youth Congress convened in 1998 to work on advancing democratic principles by involving youth in activities to improve their schools and communities. Providing an open forum for discussion, the Youth Congress brings students together to establish themselves as a strong voice in community issues and initiatives.', u'A student run organization, the Youth Congress is an advocate for parent and community participation in shaping students to reach their maximum potential. The Youth Congress endeavors to embrace and promote all forms of diversity in race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation, and works to bring understanding and acceptance to every aspect of local schools and communities. The students work to achieve these goals through promoting nonviolent organizing principles, and encouraging their schools to actively embrace peace.', u'Concerned about the overwhelming presence of violence in their schools and a growing intolerance for diversity, the Youth Congress conducted a year long study of all aspects of violence, including peaceful resolutions. The students assembled a district-wide coalition of public officials, police forces, school administrators, teachers and parents, to form a network of experience, expertise, and idea exchange. Drawing on this wealth of knowledge, the Youth Congress drafted a resolution to encourage and inspire action by their school administrators and the government officials.', u'The action points of the resolution are as follows:', u'We, the Students of the 10th Congressional District Youth Congress, for our safety and continued growth as problem solvers, critical thinkers, and involved citizens, urge you to adopt the following policies and programs:', u'Establish a core curriculum throughout all high schools on conflict resolution and diversity education. This program should devote time evenly to nonviolent conflict resolution training and in-depth studies of diversity training and acceptance. The diversity training should include, but not be limited to, studies of the civil rights movement, gay and lesbian issues, native American history, a study of the Holocaust, and a wide range of cultural and ethnic education studies.', u'Implement peer mediation and other proven student-to-student problem-solving initiatives.', u'Form a parent/student advisory board and task force charged with development and promotion of honor codes and disciplinary policies. The advisory board and task force will work to increase parent education and establish workshops to help parents teach and support nonviolent and cooperative problem-solving for families and communities.', u'Establish student review boards with oversight of honor codes and disciplinary policies. The review board will also promote on-going conflict resolution awareness and training for all students and staff.', u"Establish a policy that no student be removed from the student population without due process, and a plan for the student's eventual reentry or a clear and specific action plan for the student and family.", u'Review the role of uniformed and non-uniformed police officers as well as security staff. Promote the role of police and security as facilitators or models of effective conflict resolution. Police officials should be resources to encourage students and staff to respect differences, as well as being informed liaisons with youth- and family-serving organizations in the community.', u'Work to reduce class size to create an atmosphere conducive to appropriate learning and one that is less prone to create conflict.', u'Provide access to mental health services, through creative partnerships with community-based health and mental health providers. Establish the presence in all schools of a full range of mental health services for students and staff. Special emphasis should be placed on continuing staff training, assessment and mental health counseling for all students and families, and establishing strong links with community social service agencies.', u'Pass reasonable and uniform gun control laws within our cities, including registration and safety lock laws.', u'Study the impact of a culture that among other things, has sold violence as entertainment and promotes insensitivity to human suffering. Encourage print and electronic news media to balance their coverage of tragedy, terror, death and disaster with attention to the aspects of human existence that ennoble, enrich and empower students, families and communities and in doing so begin to tell new stories about all of us.', u'The students and youth of the Cleveland area will play a significant role in replacing our culture of violence with a culture of peace. The model they set forth this day can be used as a model in cities all across our nation.', u'My fellow colleagues, please join me in honoring the work of the 10th Congressional District Youth Congress, as these students continue to lead the way in establishing long lasting peace in our schools and communities.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/07/27/E1381-3_in-honor-of-the-10th-congressional-district-youth-/'}
