Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. As is the case too often up here, the nomination has been put on the shelf, held by a ``hold'' at the request of a few Senators.", "Before I talk about the reasons for the ``hold,'' I want to talk briefly about the history of the nomination and some facts about the nominee, Mr. Hormel, and his background.", "Last fall, following a hearing on his nomination, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 16 to 2 in favor of Mr. Hormel. This vote took place November 4, 1997. Originally, it was a voice vote. It was approved. That means by unanimous vote. Two Senators then requested to have a recorded vote and went on record in opposition. So it was a 16-2 vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is a very strong vote.", "The nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar. And despite the fact that the Senate confirmed every other Foreign Relations Committee nominee before the close of the first session--some 50 nominees in total--Jim Hormel's nomination was left languishing because of ``holds'' placed on it by a few Senators.", "Madam President, that such a distinguished and qualified nominee would face opposition is on its face hard to understand.", "Jim Hormel is first and foremost a loving and devoted father of five and a grandfather of 13. His entire family has been unfailingly supportive of his nomination. And people who know him well say he is decent, patient and a very gentle person.", "Madam President, I was very moved by a letter from Alice Turner, former wife of James Hormel, a letter written to the majority leader, Senator Lott, supporting her ex-husband's nomination. And I quote:", "I have known Jim for 46 years and for ten of those years I was married to him . . . I grew to understand the terrible prejudice and hatred that he knew he would have to face . . . and is facing as he goes through the difficult process this nomination and its opponents have put him through . . . I share with you these personal things because I gather his personal ethics have been questioned. If anyone on this earth could come close to judging that it would be me. He is a wonderful father, grandfather and friend . . . Jim Hormel has given enormously to his family, his community and to this country. He is just asking to be allowed to give one more time. This is a good man. Give him a chance.", "End of quote to Senator Lott.", "His professional credentials are equally impressive. He is an accomplished businessman. He serves as chairman of Equidex, an investment firm, and he serves as a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.", "He has also spent time as a lawyer and as an educator. He served as a dean and assistant dean of students at the University of Chicago Law School. In addition, he currently serves as a member of the board of members of his alma mater, Swarthmore College.", "Let me just give my colleagues a sampling of the kind of organizations he served on, impressive in its breadth as well as its diversity. In addition to his support for Swarthmore and the University of Chicago, he has provided resources and assistance to the Virginia Institute of Autism, Breast Cancer Action, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, the NAACP, the Institute for International Education, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish Family and Child Services, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the San Francisco Symphony.", "Many of these organizations have honored him with awards. His commitment to public service and his commitment to the cause of human rights came together when he was named as a member of the United States delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995. And there he helped the United States press its case for improved human rights in nations as diverse as China, Cuba, and Iraq.", "Finally, he was nominated in 1977 to serve as an alternative representative on the U.S. delegation to the 51st General Assembly.", "There is an irony because on May 23, 1997, the same U.S. Senate that opposes his nomination, not letting us have a vote, unanimously confirmed James Hormel to represent this country at the United Nations.", "Madam President, it seems clear to many of us why some Senators do not want to allow a vote on James Hormel's nomination. It is because James Hormel is gay. In a queer, unquestionable case of discrimination, these Senators refuse to let the full Senate vote on a qualified nominee because of his sexual orientation. Surely, the U.S. Senate does not want to be party to this kind of discrimination.", "James Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be encouraged to engage in public service. He is intelligent, civic-minded, generous, and he is a person of proven accomplishment who wants to serve our country. We need people like him in public service. We cannot afford to drive him away because of his sexual orientation.", "So, Madam President, this is a matter of simple fairness. We have before us a qualified nominee, with broad support, approved by the committee of jurisdiction. We should at least be allowed a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. If people have concerns, let them express them. Let us have a debate, and let us address them, but let us give James Hormel a chance. Let us have a vote.", "So I call on the majority leader to schedule a vote on James Hormel's nomination. I call upon those who have a hold to allow the nomination to reach the floor. If other Senators wish, let us debate the qualifications. But it is wrong to prevent the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on this nomination.", "Some of the Senators who have holds on this nomination claim that it is not because he is gay. They claim it is because of his views on certain issues involving gay rights or something to that effect. The truth is, I do not know exactly what their objections are.", "But there is a more important truth. If Senators disagree with this nomination, let them come to the floor. Let us debate this out in the open. That is what the tradition of the U.S. Senate about deliberative action is all about. So I challenge my colleagues who have holds on this nomination to come to this very floor, explain why they believe James Hormel is unfit to become an American Ambassador because he happens to be gay. Let other Senators and the American people judge on the merits of this argument.", "The issue is a very simple one. We have a qualified nominee who was resoundingly approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is entitled to a vote. And as a United States Senator, I am entitled to cast my vote for him.", "Madam President, I have language which would be a sense of the Senate to express the intention of the Senate to consider the nomination of James Hormel as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg, that the Senate would make clear its intention to consider this nomination before a certain date and to vote. I will not bring this amendment up on this bill. But this is an amendment that I will bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate on another bill. It is time for us to speak up. It is time for us to deal with what is an injustice.", "Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues from California, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. And I will work with other colleagues as well.", "Let me just conclude by reading on this matter--and I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I have just one other matter in morning business to cover, and I shall be brief--from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, ``Senate Should Be Allowed To Vote.'' In an editorial calling for Republicans to let the Senate vote on James Hormel, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram writes:", "Conservatives, like Sens. Gordon Smith of Oregon and Orrin Hatch of Utah take him at his word and support his nomination. Some others, harking to conservative groups that are part of the GOP constituency, do not. Yet they say the issue is not his sexual orientation. If it is not, then the Senate should be allowed to vote, yea or nay. If sexual orientation actually is the issue, then the Senate needs to take a look at itself in the mirror.", "I repeat that. ``If sexual orientation actually is the issue''--I say this to the majority leader. I call on the majority leader to bring this matter before the Senate for a vote. I quote the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the conclusion:", "If sexual orientation actually is the issue, then the Senate needs to take a look at itself in the mirror.", "We will not know until we have this nomination out on the floor. And we must do that. I hope the majority leader will take action. I have an amendment that I will bring to the floor if that is what is necessary. I think it is time for all of us to speak up.", "Madam President, I just have one other matter that I want to cover in morning business."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/05/04/S4197_nomination-of-james-c-hormel/"}
