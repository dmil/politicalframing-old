In one fell swoop, the U.S. Supreme Court managed to seriously undermine our tradition of democratic self-governance, and, at the same time, to deliver a harsh slap-in-the-face to all Americans who seek to preserve traditional moral standards regarding homosexuality. I hope and expect that American citizens share my sense of outrage at the Court's action.", "I'm referring to the Court's decision in the case of Romer versus Evans. The case involves an amendment to the Colorado State Constitution adopted in 1992 by the citizens of that State. The amendment, known as amendment 2, would have prevented the State or any of its political subdivisions from enacting, adopting, or enforcing any law granting homosexuals protected status or other preferential treatment. Amendment 2 was adopted in response to the actions of several Colorado cities that had adopted so-called gay rights ordinances, which had added homosexuals to the list of protected persons under local antidiscrimination laws.", "By a 6-to-3 vote, the court yesterday ruled that amendment 2 violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that amendment 2 ``lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests, and so could only be understood as an expression of animosity toward homosexuals.''", "That might sound like stale legal doctrine, but don't be deceived. What the Court did yesterday has profoundly troubling implications for our democracy and for our civilization. As Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for himself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Thomas, pointed out in his dissenting opinion, the Court has unleased a new constitutional doctrine that has no rational limitation.", "We must be clear on one important fact: Notwithstanding the majority's portrayal of amendment 2 as an effort to make homosexuals ``stranger[s] to [Colorado's] laws,'' the measure did no such thing. All amendment 2 would have accomplished is to prevent the government from making homosexuals a protected class, or otherwise to make homosexuality the basis for any preferential treatment. Every Colorado law of general applicability applies fully to homosexuals. This case, no matter what the majority held, was about whether or not homosexuals could be given special protections under the law.", "I quote from Justice Scalia's dissent:", "The only denial of equal treatment [the majority] contends homosexuals have suffered is this: They may not obtain preferential treatment without amending the state constitution. That is to say, the principle underlying the Court's opinion is that one who is accorded equal treatment under the law, but cannot as readily as others obtain preferential treatment under the laws, has been denied equal protection of the laws.", "It is tough to argue with Justice Scalia's conclusion that the Court's constitutional jurisprudence ``has achieved terminal silliness.''", "Confessing itself unable to fathom a rational, legitimate governmental purpose that might be served by amendment 2, the Court concluded that the amendment thus raised ``the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity'' toward homosexuals. The Court characterized it as ``a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group.''", "This conclusion, which lies at the core of the Court's opinion, is as puzzling as it is offensive. It's puzzling because, just 10 years ago, the Supreme Court held that nothing in the Constitution prevents States from enforcing laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy. In Bowers versus Hardwick, the Court expressly held that government can put citizens in prison for engaging in homosexual conduct.", "Now, however, we learn that the same Constitution forbids States from deciding that homosexuals should not be granted protected or preferential status under their laws. I defy anyone to explain how these two results can be reconciled.", "In a truly amazing display of intellectual dishonesty, the Court majority didn't even attempt such a reconciliation, and indeed, it didn't even mention the Bowers case.", "So there are some serious legal flaws in the Court's decision. But what truly offends me--and, I would expect, a great many Americans--is the Court's conclusion that amendment 2 was motivated by ``animosity'' toward homosexuals. Again, I quote from Justice Scalia's dissent: ``To suggest,'' he writes, ``that [Amendment 2] springs from nothing more than `a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group' is nothing short of insulting.''", "And so it is. For 2,000 years, our Judeo-Christian ethic has taught that homosexual conduct is wrong. Accordingly, our laws have always embodied some moral disapproval of homosexuality. Sometimes that disapproval takes the form of criminal sanction, as with antisodomy laws. But often it is expressed in much more subtle ways. Here, for example, the voters of Colorado decided simply not to extend their antidiscrimination protections to homosexuals as a discrete protected class. The Supreme Court has now pronounced that decision to be the result of rank bigotry, motivated only by animosity toward homosexuals. Such a crass dismissal of our moral and religious heritage should provoke outrage on the part of the American people.", "I do not come to the floor lightly to criticize our Supreme Court. I have deep respect for the institution of the Supreme Court, and I have been quick to praise the Court when it has performed its assigned constitutional role. But yesterday's decision, Mr. Speaker, does not deserve our praise; in striking down amendment 2 and in labeling as ``bigots'' adherents to traditional moral values, the Court deserves our disapproval."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/05/21/H5302_romer-versus-evans/"}
