But the other day sitting in his office at Kimbell, Sherman & Ellis--the Montpelier-based government and communications firm he started with Bob Sherman back in 1987--he looked completely relaxed. It is a small office, which he shares with his partner's son, Nick Sherman. Kimbell's chair was kicked back. His smile was broad and available. Steve Kimbell just quit his job. ``I never expected to work forever,'' he said. Well, you could have fooled most of us. And he has. In most cases more than once. Kimbell is the politician's politician, a lobbyist and counselor who has built relationships unlike any other in Vermont's political world. He started out as a Legal Aid lawyer. ``I spent my time suing state government,'' he said. ``Mostly welfare and Medicaid cases.'' And he remains a government skeptic. ``My underlying personal philosophy is that government is very dangerous,'' Kimbell said. ``It's a huge operation. And it breaks the law every day. This is the foundation of my advocacy for every client. All citizens need to be watchdogs. But we get paid to do it.'' No shock to any who know him--Steve Kimbell's decision to retire is a political one. He tied it to Jim Douglas' decision not to run for a fifth term. He pointed out that a political shift like the one we may see this election cycle only comes along every decade or so. Whatever happens there will be a new political cast. So it seemed to him like the right time to give a different generation a chance. There was nothing sudden about his decision. The partners in the firm have been planning for this for a year. But wary of making Kimbell a lame duck in his final legislative session they kept the story close, a remarkable accomplishment in a town that does not guard political secrets particularly well. Not at all, most of the time. I asked him if he could really quit. ``I have gotten up and gone to work for 40 years,'' he said, ``either working for myself or somebody else. It will be a major change but it's worth a shot.'' He says he is going to tend the farm in Tunbridge. I am not 100 percent convinced. Kimbell's career spans the terms of every governor since Tom Salmon--Salmon, Snelling, Kunin, Snelling again, Dean and Douglas. He reflected. ``Governors are not noted for their sense of humor,'' Kimbell said, referencing a quality he values in politicians--politicians like Art Gibb, Bob Gannett and Ralph Wright. ``Snelling made an art form of being the intimidating presence in the room.'' Not very funny. ``Howard was frantic. Not much time for levity.'' But Salmon, Kimbell said, was funny. ``He would hop into his state police car and say 'Let's go to Boston.' And he'd go to see a Red Sox game.'' Kimbell first got directly involved in electoral politics in almost as off-hand a manner. ``After the '78 session I was leaving the Statehouse with Madeleine [Kunin]. She was chair of the Appropriations Committee and running for lieutenant governor. 'I need a campaign manager,' she said. I got paid $150 a week. She beat Peter Smith by 2,500 votes.'' And he recalled how Kunin won. ``Within earshot of reporters, Peter Smith said that 'all the broads' were going to vote for Madeleine. That ill- advised comment is what swung the election.'' When Kunin was governor Kimbell served for two years as her state planning director, the person in charge of the administration's legislative program. ``I found that I didn't really like working inside the government,'' he said. ``I got out and went back to my private practice.'' Then came the partnership with Kunin's press secretary, Bob Sherman. ``We went to Seyon Pond fishing and talked about what we really ought to do. We concluded that combining law and journalism in a firm to do advocacy was a good idea.'' And to call it just that is an understatement. Kimbell Sherman & Ellis has no peer in Vermont. Not only is it the most successful lobbying firm in the state, it has also built an out-of-state client list which now represents about half of the business. It has offices in Washington and does business all over the country, tracking and reporting on issues and also specializing in crisis management. When I asked Kimbell about the most dramatic moment in his political memory, he recalled the death of Richard Snelling in August of 1991. ``How many times does a sitting governor just drop dead,'' he said. Howard Dean was in touch almost immediately. ``Howard called Sherman and said 'I need a speech within an hour,''' Kimbell recalled. ``And we helped the new governor make the transition. He was here for a lot of meetings. And we took some heat. The press said 'How can these lobbyists advise the new governor.' A lot of the criticism was probably warranted, but sometimes you just have to do things.'' And Howard Dean is not the only politician to have beaten a path to Steve Kimbell's door. For a couple of decades now candidates and potential candidates have come to Kimbell & company. They want to know--from someone who does--if they should or if they shouldn't. ``We are in the business of politics,'' Kimbell said. ``It doesn't matter where they come from. If they want to talk to us, we give advice.'' And Steve Kimbell has brought this sort of matter-of-fact attitude to all his efforts. Despite his highly visible work for civil unions and gay marriage, he insists that his approach is always the same. ``I'm an advocate,'' Kimbell said. ``I take a hard-nosed approach. To do this job you have got to be well prepared, emotionless and tenacious. Gay marriage was a hugely emotional issue. I worked very hard to be analytical and strategic. It is my personal belief that that is what people pay us for.'' Hard-nosed. True enough. Savvy. Unparalleled. Matter-of-fact. Certainly. Passionate. Despite protestations. And funny.
