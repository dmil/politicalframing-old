Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.', u'In the early morning of July 15, 2007, Miranda Greer, an openly lesbian woman, was brutally attacked in a Jackson, TN, bar. Greer had been dancing when a man approached her and, using a homophobic slur, asked her to leave. The man had apparently mistaken Greer for a gay male. When she clarified that she was a lesbian, the man punched her in the face. He then used the bottom of a beer bottle to jab her left eye, and broke it over the back of her head. Greer ended up with a blind spot in her left eye after the attack. Police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Tyler Mansfield, who was identified as a suspect according to the Jackson Police Department.', u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/04/08/S2739-2_the-matthew-shepard-act-of-2007/'}
