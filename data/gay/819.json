In addition, the current Director of National Intelligence, who is responsible for verification, supports this treaty. And LTG Patrick O'Reilly, head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, says that the New START treaty actually reduces constraints on the development of missile defense.", u"I think her comments were very articulate, but they are not correct, because, again, I will place into the Record the many leaders from former Republican administrations who are pressing us hard to get this treaty done. As a matter of fact, we haven't had boots on the ground to verify what the Russians are doing for a long time now. This treaty will make sure we can verify. But whether it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates, or Patrick O'Reilly, as I said, head of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, or the Director of National Intelligence--you also have former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger saying he doesn't believe this inhibits missile defense. You have the former Secretary of Defense under President Clinton, William Perry, being very strong on this, along with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and so on. In the Washington Post, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Colin Powell made the following statement. ``New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses.'' The testimonies of our military commanders and civilian leaders make it clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans.", u"I think the biggest danger to our country is not acting on this. If we don't act, it is a danger to the national security of this Nation. I am very pleased to see the incredible bipartisan support outside of this Chamber and, I hope, inside this Chamber. I am very hopeful. But we will find out in the coming days.", u'I want to also talk about the two very critical votes we cast here moments ago, which are so important to large segments of our communities. The DREAM Act, which would give a path of legality to students who are outstanding in their communities and who want to join the military, or go to college, is an important bill. Because of the filibuster we needed 60 votes. We got 55 votes--a majority--but the Republican filibuster stopped us from passing it.', u'Today the dreams of young, talented students who grew up in America were crushed because of a filibuster. We have to make it clear to the people who follow this that the Republicans stopped us from passing the DREAM Act, even though we had a few of them join us. I say thank you to those on the other side. We got 55 votes. We had 90 percent of Democrats voting for it and less than 10 percent of Republicans--90 percent of Republicans voted against it. Today, dreams were crushed. ', u'I believe in America. My mother was born in a foreign land and, by the grace of God, she was naturalized, and she kissed the ground of this country. I often think to myself, what if she had a foul-up in her papers somehow, what would have happened to me? Would I be a different person? No, I would be the same human being. America would be my country.', u"The reason I am so passionate on this is these are young people who would make our country stronger. As a matter of fact, our military says the DREAM Act is a recruiter's dream, because we get the best and the brightest to sign up for the military. In my State, where I am so proud of our incredible diversity, we have a group of young people who are ready to go to college there, start their own businesses there, get jobs there, form their families there, work in their communities. They already are.", u'I have shown on the floor of the Senate many times individuals who were caught in this limbo state. A lot of them are presidents of their student bodies, A students, leaders in their communities. Studies show that if the DREAM Act passes, the gross domestic product of our Nation will increase. There is a very good study, a recent study by USC, the University of Southern California, that is very clear on the point.', u'It seems to me what we did today by failing to end the filibuster, even though we had a strong majority vote, we hurt our country. Why did we hurt our country? Because our children are our future. These are very bright young people, who are very motivated. They would be the only ones to benefit from the DREAM Act.', u'I am here today with a message: I will never give up until we pass the DREAM Act.', u"On the good side today, from my perspective, we made some history. We did break a filibuster--a Republican filibuster--on the issue of ending discrimination in the military against gays and lesbians. We voted to end that filibuster and take up the issue of the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I do believe, in a few hours, that policy will be gone.", u'There are moments in history that come to us, and for me to be here at this time--and I know I speak for a lot of colleagues--and cast a right for civil rights, cast a vote for justice, cast a vote for equality, and to cast a vote against discrimination is a high honor.', u"I have to say as a point of personal privilege, I was here when that policy went into effect. It was 1993 and I was a new Member of the Senate. I thought this was the wrong policy at that time. So I said to my staff: Can't we do something and stop this? We decided the best way to try to stop it was to say let's not codify this policy. Let's not put it into law. Let's have an amendment that says it is up to the executive branch. That way, the executive branch could repeal it if it didn't work, and it would be easier.", u"It is interesting because our thoughts were right on target, because our President does not support don't ask, don't tell, and he would, in a heartbeat, of course, remove it as a policy through Executive order. But because we had voted it into law, we had to act.", u"I decided to go back to the speech I made on that day, September 9, 1993, and take a look at some of the things I said about don't ask, don't tell. First, I said, on the question of codification--that is, putting don't ask, don't tell into law:", u'There is no historic precedent for the codification of the military personnel policy that prevents a whole class of Americans from serving their country in the Armed Forces.', u'I felt it was against precedent, and I said:', u'There is simply no compelling reason to believe we should break with history and codify such a policy.', u'I mentioned that, over the past four decades, Congress had declined to impose restrictive personnel policies on the military. I quoted a former Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Barry Goldwater, who stated:', u'Banning loyal Americans from the Armed Forces because of their sexual orientation is just plain un-American.', u'I said the policy is a policy of outright discrimination, which flies in the face of the very American values that the military has sworn to defend.', u'I lauded the courage of those military personnel who were willing to come forward and testify before Congress way back then. And, of course, fast forward to today, it is incredible that brave men and women serving in uniform in Iraq and in Afghanistan, who put their careers on the line, can stand up and be counted and speak truth to power about this issue.', u'I think this is an important point. The military has a very strict code of conduct, which it must have. So everybody in the military must adhere to it, whether you are heterosexual, homosexual, or whatever your orientation is; you have to live by the code of conduct. In 1993 we had just come through this horrible scandal called Tailhook. It was awful. You had a series of rapes, and you had a very bad circumstance, which was brought out into the public. Action was taken. So, clearly, heterosexuals in the military, when they misbehave in a sexual way, are going to be punished. It is the same way for improper homosexual behavior. It will not be tolerated.', u"That is the point. I said that don't ask, don't tell is a policy of discrimination based on your status instead of your behavior.", u'Here is something else I said in 1993:', u"It is easy to lose sight of the impact that policies have on people's lives. It is easy to label people that are different from us as ``those people.'' We might be able to temporarily fool ourselves into thinking that those people are not part of our social fabric.", u'I read into the Record some writing of a German philosopher, who wrote about World War II, in which he said:', u"When the Nazis came for the Jews, I didn't speak up because I was not a Jew. And when the Nazis came for the gypsies, I didn't speak up because I was not a gypsy. And when the Nazis came for the mentally defective, I didn't speak up because I was not mentally defective. When the Nazis came for me, there was no one left to speak up.", u"So I said: Let's not do this to gay and lesbian people. Let's have a code of behavior that affects us all and does not divide us. We fool ourselves when we say that the gay and lesbian community is not part of our social fabric; that they are not human; that they do not have an effect on our lives. That isn't right. We are all God's children and they are our sons and our daughters.", u"So in a couple of hours, for me, this issue comes full circle. I got 33 votes that day in 1993 for my amendment not to codify don't ask, don't tell. I got 33 votes, and I was proud of that. I remember Howard Metzenbaum--may he rest in peace--said at that time: The Boxer amendment is a civil rights amendment, and I was proud. But I was so sad to lose badly--33 votes. Today--today--we have come a long way, and we have come a long way because people have put their fear aside and they came forward and they told their stories. They took the light and they focused it on the truth. We have come a long way because of their families who love them and have spoken out. We have come a long way because the military itself, in the Pentagon's recently released survey, said it doesn't matter. Seventy percent of our servicemembers said we don't care about sexual orientation.", u'So this is America at its best--when we open our arms to equality and freedom and justice.', u'In closing, I would say there is more work we have to do on this whole issue. There is still a lot of unfairness in our laws--partners not being able to have the same rights as married couples. That is another whole issue we will work on. But I am confident that as Americans we will move forward. When we started out, only White men of property could vote. We have struggled. All this is a struggle. It is not easy. The struggle for freedom is not easy. People have died for freedom in all these communities. It is in our history. But this will be a day that will go down in American history as a day we lifted a barrier, and America is stronger because of it.', u'I yield the floor.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/S10668-2_sbirsttr-reauthorization-act-of-1999-continued/'}
