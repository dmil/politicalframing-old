Remember him? Sometimes we forget him in the discussion of tax cuts and gay marriage and all the other issues--but he is still out there and still threatening our country, and especially New York and Washington, almost everyday.", "Al-Qaeda is not human--but we need to be ready for other attacks. That means proactive preparedness, as well as improving our reactive response as well.", "Proactively, we need to better protect our urban areas--the terrorist targeted areas--like New York.", "New York was the target in 1993 when terrorists bombed the World Trade Center, and again on September 11, 2001, when they completed the job they started 8 years earlier. New York City is the most targeted city in the country and likely on Earth by terrorists.", "This is a reality Congress and the White House need to face. And if we are serious about protecting America--all Americans--regardless of their voting patterns, then we must go about protecting these most targeted and most vulnerable areas.", "And I don't just say New York City is targeted to get my hometown more money. We know we are targeted due to information our U.S. intelligence services provide to us.", "Being on al-Qaeda's hit list is one of the few distinctions New York City has that I am not proud of, and not happy to talk about.", "But we must talk about it--because it is, again, reality.", "I salute the Appropriations Committee for working with me and agreeing to the amendment I offered with my colleague from New York, Vito Fossella, to increase the current urban area security initiative by $20 million--a $12.7 million increase over last year. But more funding is needed.", "But this issue of homeland security and ensuring the resources are there for our first responders--both for proactive and reactive preparedness--is more then an issue of funding in total dollar amounts. It comes down to the flawed funding formulas developed by Congress and the Bush White House to distribute homeland security dollars.", "These flawed formulas were crystallized last week when President Bush announced a 40 percent cut in urban security aid to New York City, saying the funds weren't needed for us.", "Instead, these urban security dollars went to places like Louisville, Kentucky, while certainly at risk, cannot claim to have the critical infrastructure of New York City under the terrorist microscope.", "This is a reality too--a sad and pathetic reality that our homeland security dollars have become the latest pot of federal funding to be politicized by this White House instead of being used to protect Americans at greatest risk of terror attack.", "Other realities:", "Our country takes urban security funds created for places like New York and diverts them to Louisville;", "Our Nation provides more homeland security dollars per capita to Wyoming than to New York;", "And sadly, protecting our homeland security is more about politics than security.", "We haven't caught Osama bin Laden, the Taliban is returning to Afghanistan, and Congress is not providing the funds to our first responders to protect our targeted cities--our Nation's homeland security is a sad reflection of our great country."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/08/E1066-3_department-of-homeland-security-appropriations-act/"}
