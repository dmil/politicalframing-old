This day is a long time coming, and I am proud we have successfully stood up against hate crimes in this country. Such acts will not be tolerated in our society. The American public supported this goal. According to a Gallup poll from 2007, 68 percent of Americans support extending hate crimes protection to groups based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including 60 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of individuals who frequently attend church.", "Hate crimes continue to occur in our country every day. According to recent FBI data, there were over 7,600 reported hate crimes in the United States in 2007. That is nearly one every hour of every day. Over 150 of those instances occurred in my home State of Maryland. ", "The passage of the legislation demonstrates that the Congress is fighting for people such as Stephen Johns, who was killed at the U.S. Holocaust Museum; Lawrence King, a 15-year-old student murdered in his high school because he was gay; James Byrd, who was beaten and dragged by a truck for 2 miles because he was Black; and for the 28-year-old California woman who was gang-raped by four men because she was a lesbian. Today, we stand and say: No more. No longer shall we tolerate these types of actions.", "During the recent confirmation hearing of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, I spoke about the importance of standing against hate. I expressed the importance of a Justice and a Court that will continue to move forward in protecting civil rights and not turning back the clock. I hope the Court will stand with us against such actions and continue to protect important civil rights laws.", "According to the recent Leadership Conference on Civil Rights education fund report entitled ``Confronting the New Faces of Hate,'' hate crimes against Latinos has been increasing steadily since 2003. This marked increase also closely correlates with the increasing heated debate over comprehensive immigration reform. There was also a 5-year high in victimization rates in 2007 toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered individuals. That number has increased by almost 6 percent. The number of White supremacy groups has increased by 54 percent, and African Americans continue to experience the largest number of hate crimes, with an annual number essentially unchanged over the past 10 years. While religion-based offenses decreased, the number of reported anti-Jewish crimes increased slightly between 2006 and 2007. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a necessary and appropriate response to this ongoing threat to our communities.", "Currently, 45 States and the District of Columbia have enacted hate crime laws and have taken a stand against hate in their own States. Thirty-one of those States have already included sexual orientation in their definition of what constitutes a hate crime. Twenty-seven States and the District of Columbia prohibit violent crimes based on a victim's gender. States have a patchwork of hate crimes statutes that leaves gaps which need to be filled in order to have an effective response and prosecution of these crimes.", "The Federal Government has a clear responsibility to respond to hate crimes. Current Federal hate crime laws are based only on race, color, national origin, and religion. We need to include gender, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.", "Current law also requires the victim to be participating in a federally protected activity, such as attending school or voting. Those who commit hate crimes are not bound to certain jurisdictions, and neither should the people who prosecute them, which is why this legislation removes the requirement that a victim be participating in a federally protected activity. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act will make sure all Americans are equally protected against hate crimes.", "The legislation will provide necessary resources to our State and local governments to fight hate crimes. Specifically, it will provide grants for State, local, and tribal law enforcement entities for prosecuting, programming, and education related to hate crimes prosecution and prevention. The bill will assist States and provide them with additional resources, not diminish their role in managing criminal activities within their own States. The bill supplements State and local law enforcement efforts.", "Additionally and most importantly, the legislation was carefully drafted to maintain protections for Americans' first amendment rights. Nothing in this legislation diminishes an American's freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom to assemble. The Supreme Court has already ruled that such laws do not obstruct free speech. Let me be clear: The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act targets acts, not speech.", "Hate crimes affect not just the victims; they victimize the entire community and make residents fearful. We cannot allow our communities to be terrorized by hatred and violence. Today, we hold true to our promise for a better tomorrow.", "Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/10/22/S10663-2_national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year/"}
