That individual is E. William Crotty, and he is affectionately known to all of us who are friends of Bill Crotty as Bill Crotty.", "He had the distinction of being appointed the ambassador to seven Caribbean nations by President Clinton last November and has been in that position until his death just a few days ago.", "To his family, we want to extend our deepest condolences, extend our sympathy to his wife Valerie and his children and his relatives.", "I have known Bill Crotty for many years. I happen to be a Republican. I am actually in a family dominated by some pretty prominent Democrats. Bill Crotty was a Democrat's Democrat. But although he and I sometimes differed on political parties, we agreed more often on the need to serve our community, to serve our State, and to serve our Nation.", "The untimely death of Bill Crotty this week has left our community with a great void. It has left the Democrat party with a tremendous loss. He was one of the largest sources of support, financial assistance, and dedication for the Democrat party of any individual I know in the United States.", "He took on every challenge with a great energy particularly in support of his party and his candidates and also, as I said, in the best interest of his community, State, and Nation.", "He was appointed United States ambassador to the Caribbean nations of Barbados, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, Saint Kitts, Nevis, and St. Vincent, and the Grenadines.", "Since he assumed that post, I had the honor and privilege of talking with Bill Crotty and working with him. We both had a common interest in that region; and that was to bring stability, to bring economic development and trade to that area of the Caribbean.", "One of our mutual concerns was the problem of illegal narcotics. Just some weeks ago, Bill had written me and sent me these letters and clips and he said, ``Dear John, enclosed please find an article that appeared in the July 23rd edition of the Grenada Today. The article discusses deportees, but the thrust is drug trafficking.''", "He goes on to discuss the possibility of our visiting with a delegation and meeting with leaders in the Caribbean to help them in their efforts to combat illegal narcotics. He closed by saying, ``It will be a real honor for my wife and I to host you and your delegation. I will send you additional materials I think may interest you concerning drug trafficking and Caribbean matters.''", "Again, just recently discussing with Bill Crotty, our ambassador, this particular situation we face in the Caribbeans on illegal narcotics, I have an article that was published just before his death that spoke of Bill Crotty's determination to make a difference in the post in which he was appointed to serve. The article from the Daytona Beach News Journal in Central Florida said, for example, ``He delivered a state-of-the-art Fairchild C-26 aircraft from the United States Government to Barbados. Prime Minister Owen Arthur was the recipient and received this as part of an $11 million support package to the regional security system in the Caribbean to help fight drug trafficking.''", "We have lost with the death of Bill Crotty, again, an individual who was dedicated to his community, to his party, and also an ally with me in the war against illegal narcotics. His untimely death again leaves us all at a loss. But we do want to extend our very deepest sympathy to his family who now have grief as Bill has left us. Again, Mr. Speaker, we pay tribute tonight to E. William Crotty, United States Ambassador.", "When I speak on the floor of the House every Tuesday night and get an opportunity, I like to talk about some of the items in the news and I led tonight with the obituary of a good friend and dedicated American. But it appears to me that almost every time anyone picks up a newspaper or turns on the television or hears some media report, that individual in the United States or in any of our communities hears more and more about the effects of illegal narcotics.", "Leading the news this week was the death in Laramie, Wyoming, of a young, gay man who was beaten to death by several individuals. Some have referred to it as a hate crime.", "No matter how it is referred to, it was a horrible incident. And I know the State of Wyoming and many people in the community of Laramie, Wyoming, are saddened by that occurrence in their community and that tragic death.", "What captured my imagination and attention, again dealing with the question of illegal narcotics as chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Drug Policy, is the headline that said ``Shepard-Death Defendant to Claim Impairment.'' This is the headline in Tuesday, October 12 Washington Times. The first paragraph says, ``Laramie, Wyoming. The attorney for a man charged with beating college student Matthew Shepard to death said yesterday his client's judgment was clouded by drugs and alcohol.''", "Again even as we face the most tragic events of our time that are publicized in the media, we look at some of the root problems beyond hate, beyond theft and robbery, beyond other charges that have been alleged, and we see drugs and alcohol and substance abuse as possibly the root cause of these crimes. Again, this entire area of illegal narcotics and substance abuse has taken its toll across our Nation. ", "Last week, I reported the most recent statistics indicate that over 5,200 Americans died last year from drug-induced deaths. I do not think Matthew Shepard's death will be counted in those statistics as I have cited many others who have died as the result of someone being involved with illegal narcotics. But the toll continues to rise and rise. In addition to the deaths, we have the incarceration of 1.8 million, close to 2 million total Americans in our jails, our prisons. Our judiciary system is clogged at tremendous expense to the taxpayer with people who have committed serious felonies, crimes, robberies, murders and other illegal acts either under the influence of illegal narcotics or in dealing with illegal narcotics. The toll from illegal drugs in our country continues to rise.", "Also in the news, relating to illegal narcotics, is a debate that has really tied up the other body, the United States Senate, and the House of Representatives with several pieces of legislation. As my colleagues may know, the President has vetoed the D.C. appropriations measure. One of the provisions in that particular bill does restrict needle exchange programs. It is now one of the problem areas that the House of Representatives and Congress, the other body, find ourselves in conflict with the administration. They want to promote these needle exchanges. It has caused the veto in part of this particular bill relating to funding D.C. government. The Congress is also embroiled in a battle to fund several major departments. One of the largest bills that we will face in Congress is the education, labor and human services bill, HHS bill as we refer to it. Recently, the other body struck a provision that would have allowed the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary to create a clean needle exchange program for drug users. In some of the debates on that, one of the quotes that struck me was ``giving an addict a clean needle is like giving an alcoholic a clean glass,'' said one of the sponsors of that legislation in the other body.", "What was also interesting is a study that was referred to. I have not read all the details of this study and I have used the example of Baltimore which has had a very liberal policy and needle exchange program and which has, I believe, since 1989 increased its addiction level some five or six times. As it was reported and I cited and quoted a member of the Baltimore city council who said one out of eight citizens in the city of Baltimore is now a heroin addict. Part of this, we can trace back to the needle exchange program. But this quote in the Washington Times from last Friday says that ``we have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that needle exchange programs increase the rate of HIV infection and the use of drugs.''", "Cited in this article is a Vancouver, British Columbia case where the number of drug-related overdoses has increased fivefold since 1988, the year the city began its own free needle exchange program. In Canada, we have an example of when you have a liberalized policy and needle exchange program, the statistics also prove that needle exchange programs actually increase the rate of HIV infection according to this report. Again in Canada and a city like Baltimore, we have seen a dramatic increase in the rise of addicts as we see a more liberalized policy.", "Also in the news is a report from the Boston Globe that I thought I would mention tonight. This is a story that we all heard a great deal about some years ago and that was the death of the top Boston Celtics draft pick, Len Bias. His death occurred some 13 years ago. It was a cocaine-related overdose death. Federal prosecutors for the first time in Massachusetts said yesterday that the law bearing Len Bias' name will be used to charge an alleged drug dealer with the overdose of a customer. Again, this report is from just last Friday.", "Alarmed by high levels of heroin purity and an acute statewide overdose problem, United States Attorney Donald K. Stern said Federal and State prosecutors are preparing to bring more cases under the statute. Called the Len Bias Law, it was passed by Congress amid the uproar surrounding the University of Maryland basketball star's death in 1986. It levies stiff Federal penalties on drug dealers whose sales can be directly tied to fatal overdoses. A drug dealer is looking at a maximum of a 20-year prison term on State manslaughter charges.", "This is the quote by Mr. Stern who is the U.S. Attorney there. He said that those individuals would face a minimum 20-year sentence in Federal court and the possibility of life without parole under the Len Bias Law.", "``One such dealer,'' Stern said, ``was 61-year-old Anibal Soler of Holyoke. Solo was charged with selling Edward Thompson of Chicopee a fatal dose of heroin that officials say was 72 percent pure. High purity heroin can be deadly if users are expecting a less potent dose and take too much.''", "One of the things that I have tried to point out here and that we have pointed out in our subcommittee hearings and testimony we have had from medical experts is that the heroin and cocaine and some of the other narcotics that we see today are not the same purity level as the cocaine and heroin we saw in the 1970s and 1980s. This particular case had a 72 percent purity. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, they were looking at 5, 6, 7 percent pure heroin. This ends up by saying that high purity heroin can be deadly if users are expecting a less potent dose and take too much.", "That is exactly what is happening. We have a flood of high purity heroin, high purity cocaine and other designer drugs that are potentially fatal in very small doses. That is why we are seeing in my community, in central Florida, for example, we have had over 60 heroin overdoses. In fact, in central Florida, a headline is blurted out that overdoses from drugs now exceed homicides in central Florida.", "What is particularly disturbing is our young people in particular are falling victim to these overdoses and fatalities and they do not realize that this high purity illegal narcotic that is available in our streets and in our communities is so deadly and so potent.", "To deal with some of the problems we have had, I have got a news story from the Washington Times but it is actually a story on what has happened in Florida. I had the opportunity earlier this fall to meet with the governor and also his new drug czar, Jim McDonough, in Orlando on one of the occasions in which a daylong kickoff was celebrated to start a statewide antinarcotics program. It is a multifaceted program which encompasses prevention, education, enforcement, treatment, a whole array and a whole attack on the illegal narcotics problem that we face not only in central Florida but across Florida.", "Our governor, Jeb Bush, has done an incredible job in bringing together the State, first in a statewide coordinated meeting in the capital, Tallahassee, earlier this year, with the President of the Florida Senate, Toni Jennings, and the Speaker of the Florida House, John Thrasher, in a joint conference and effort to bring together all of the most knowledgeable people on the illegal narcotics problem, a summit that has produced results. Part of the results was this kickoff. The governor said he would adopt a plan of action, institute a drug czar's office, which he has done, and Jim McDonough, who is a former deputy national drug czar, is now heading up that post. They have discussed a plan, they have developed a plan, they have announced a plan and I am pleased that Jeb Bush and other leaders in our State are now executing a plan.", "The headline here on Friday reads, ``Florida Raids on Raves Result in 1,219 Arrests.'' If you do illegal drugs in Florida, we are going to go after you. The governor has made this commitment. I have made the commitment. We have established through central Florida, from Tampa now through Orlando and up almost to Jacksonville, and we will be including Jacksonville, a HIDTA, that is a high intensity drug traffic area. We also have one in Florida. These are designations by Federal law that take every possible law enforcement resource and other resources, local and State, combined with Federal agencies in an effort to combat illegal narcotics. We are going after individuals who deal in death caused by illegal narcotics.", "This particular article says that statewide raids on all-night dance parties, known as raves, resulted in 1,219 arrests and the seizure of nearly $9.4 million in drugs, cash, weapons and vehicles. The raids, which were dubbed ``Operation Heat Rave,'' were in response to six rave-related drug deaths around the State, including two this summer, according to State drug czar Jim McDonough. ", "Jim McDonough is quoted as follows: ``Had this been a roller coaster ride and we had had six dead, there would have been a major outcry to close down the theme park until we could do something about that roller coaster ride.''", "I think Jim McDonough states here that people would be outraged if, in any other instance, there were that many young people killed.", "In this raid across the State, State and local law enforcement officers moved against 57 businesses in 21 counties from September 29 through October 4. Officers seized more than 15 kilograms of cocaine, more than 500 pounds of marijuana, and smaller quantities of heroin and methamphetamines. They also seized designer drugs, Ecstacy, GHP, and other drugs such as the rape drugs. So it is nice to see people in public office who set out a plan and then execute a plan and follow through with their commitments, and I am pleased that Governor Jeb Bush and others in our State are following through. Again, part of the news.", "Also, I wanted to call to the attention of my colleagues and the entire Congress a little game that is being played on the question of certification, drug certification. Having been involved in the passing and actually authorship of the United States drug decertification law, I know a little bit about how it was set up to work and how it should work.", "This article talks about what I consider sort of a little attempt to undermine the United States drug decertification law. Let me read a little bit about it. It is from the Oppenheimer Report and it was published in the Miami Herald. It said, ``At a September 2nd meeting in Ottawa, the 34 Nation Organization of American States approved a plan supported by the Clinton administration,'' now that concerns me, ``to create a multinational evaluation system which the OAS,'' Organization of American States, ``hopes will eventually replace the controversial U.S. score board.''", "I am very disturbed that the Clinton administration would want to do away with our drug decertification law. I am concerned that, first of all, they have misapplied the law.", "The drug decertification law is a simple law. It says that any Nation who wishes to receive benefits of the United States, foreign aid, foreign assistance, trade assistance, trade benefits, international financial assistance from the United States, any Nation who receives the largesse of the United States is asked to cooperate with the United States in an effort to eliminate either the production or trafficking of illegal narcotics. It is a simple law. Every year, the President must send to the Congress a list of those countries whether or not they are assisting the United States, an evaluation is made whether they are assisting the United States through stopping illegal narcotics, either in their country or the production in their country or trafficking in their country. It is a simple law. We give them our benefits.", "Now, why in the world would we want to transfer to other nations an evaluation process that allows people to have benefits such as foreign aid, financial assistance, trade assistance? Why would we want to give that evaluation ability to some international body or to others? The Clinton administration has misapplied the decertification. They decertified Colombia, and they should have allowed for a national interest waiver, even though they felt Colombia was not properly cooperating, but they had problems with this administration; had problems with Colombia's human rights operations and attitudes and actions, and instead, they decertified Colombia without what we provided in the law, which was a national interest waiver, a United States national interest waiver to allow us to continue to assist in one specific area, and that would be the fight against illegal narcotics. And because of that misapplication of a very good law, we, in fact, have an incredible production of illegal narcotics from Colombia, and I will try to talk a little bit more about that tonight.", "But this is sad that this administration still does not understand why that law was instituted or how that law should be applied. By the same token, they took the decertification law and certified Mexico as cooperating in the war on illegal narcotics. Mexico should have been decertified, but also granted a national interest waiver. So what they have done is made a joke of the law and made the law ineffective.", "And now, to circumvent the intent of Congress and the intent of that law, again, if a country is going to receive benefits from the United States, why in the world would we allow some multinational organization to evaluate whether those countries would be eligible? It is our trade benefits, it is our foreign aid, it is our financial assistance. All we ask for is minimal cooperation efforts to curtail illegal narcotics.", "So both in the case of Mexico they have distorted the law, and in the case of Colombia they have perverted the law, and now, much to our disadvantage, in Mexico, 50, 60 percent of all illegal narcotics coming into the United States either are transited or are produced in Mexico, and now 60 to 70 percent of the heroin and cocaine is both produced and trafficked from Colombia, a lot of it through Mexico. In 6 years they have managed to make Colombia the largest producer of cocaine and heroin in the world, and the largest supplier to the United States. Talk about a messed up policy. This is an incredible fiasco and could get worse if we pass on to these other countries this certification responsibility.", "I have cited and spent part of my last talk reflecting on some of the comments that Governor Gary Johnson made in a Cato Institute program in Washington, I believe it was, last week. He is the Republican governor of New Mexico. He has advocated legalization and decriminalization of what are now illegal narcotics. I will not get into all of the comments and debate about some of the things he said while he was here; and he has said as governor in regard to this, but I would like to cite a news story that was out in the Associated Press just in the last couple of days that says, ``Albuquerque: A Federal drug agent, head of the FBI in New Mexico and the Otero County sheriff have resigned from a panel that advises Governor Gary Johnson on drugs saying, they are upset by the governor's escalating push for legalized drugs.''", "Let me read more from the story, and again, it will not be my quote, but their quote. They are quoted here as saying, ``We can't be running away from the problems,'' said Sandoval County Sheriff Ray Rivera, the Council's chairman. ``I feel like those folks are running away from the problem instead of standing up.'' And this is someone who expressed concern about those who resigned, creating a great debate; and it went on not only here in Washington, but in his own State.", "We also have one of the agents who resigned, David Kitchen, agent in charge of the FBI, quoted as saying in his resignation letter, and he noted earlier, he told Johnson he admired his courage in calling for a debate on decriminalization, although Kitchen thought it was sending a false message. Then came Johnson's statement advocating legalized marijuana and heroin. ``Those absolutely stunned me, especially since they came the same day a multiagency task force arrested more than 30 people accused of being part of a drug ring that operated in northern New Mexico for years,'' Kitchen wrote.", "Hansen, another one who resigned, in his letter of resignation Tuesday objected to what he said was Johnson's apparent theory that, and I will quote him, ``that since we are not winning the drug war, we should just stop fighting. That position makes a mockery of the dedicated men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration,'' Hansen wrote. ``Your radical proposal to legalize drugs will only heighten the legitimate fear and foreboding that drug users and their related crimes inspire. One need only look within New Mexico to find prominent and disheartening examples of families and communities devastated by drug use,'' he went on to say.", "So there are others that are concerned and also critical of Governor Johnson's position, and I am sure that debate will continue. We have held several hearings in my subcommittee on the question of legalization, decriminalization, and some of the facts we found do not jive exactly with what Governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico has advocated; and again, as I said, that debate and discussion will continue here in the Congress and across the Nation. ", "Also in the news is another example of a failed policy by this administration that is quite disturbing, and that is an article a few weeks ago here in the Washington Post, Tuesday, September 28 that says, ``Haiti's police accused of lawlessness.'' What is absolutely stunning is after spending $3 billion to $4 billion of American hard-earned taxpayer dollars in Haiti in the so-called nation-building effort, we have ended up now with a case of Haiti having a police force trained under some of those programs financed by the United States as a center for some illegal narcotics activities and drug smuggling in the Caribbean. This particular report in the Washington Post says, ``Created four years ago to usher in a new era of impartial justice, the United States-trained Haitian National Police is grappling with allegations that its officers have been involved in a waive of murders, disappearances of detainees and drug-related crimes and other illegal activities.''", "And this is a quote within the story: ``If you are asking me whether I am more concerned about rot in the police than a year ago, the answer is yes,'' said Collin Granderson, Executive Director of an international civilian mission here run by the Organization of American States in the United Nations. We have both human rights concerns and concerns about broader conduct of officers, specifically with respect to criminal activity and particularly drug trafficking. Allegations of police involvement in the drug trade have continued to surface in a country that has become a major transshipment point for cocaine and heroin, both to the United States and from South America. It is absolutely incredible that we would spend billions of taxpayer dollars in a nation-building effort and in these programs to stabilize the judiciary and the police and create a little center of illegal narcotics drug trafficking in Haiti. Again, a failed policy of the Clinton administration.", "Tonight I want to talk in addition to some of the news stories and other comments, I want to talk again about what has happened in the United States since 1992, and I have repeatedly said that in 1993 when President Clinton was elected, he basically closed down the war on illegal narcotics, and I have cited very specifically, and we have the programs that deal with illegal narcotics, stopping illegal narcotics coming into the United States, first of all, stopping illegal narcotics at their source.", "In 1993 we can see, with a Democrat House, Senate, and White House, basically they slashed and cut in half all of the cost-effective source country programs to stop illegal narcotics at their source, just a dramatic change. We get back to where the Republicans took over the Congress in 1995, and we see us back then, if we take 1992 dollars, we are just about back to that position.", "The war on drugs has been basically closed down internationally by the Clinton administration. Not only did we stop the international programs which are so cost-effective, and I have used this chart also before, but the programs as far as enforcement, particularly interdicting illegal narcotics from their source to our borders, again, a dramatic decrease, 1992-1993.", "They closed down these programs. They took the military out of the drug war. They took the Coast Guard out. All of the U.S. resources were slashed. Again, back in 1995, with the Republicans taking over, we are beginning to put Humpty-Dumpty together again, and the war on drugs back together again. We are almost back to 1992 level funding.", "I have also pointed out what is absolutely dramatic is if we look at illegal drug usage among our 12th graders and our teenagers, this starts in 1989, this chart. We see, if this chart continued towards me, we see this continual decrease of use among our 12th graders of different types of drug use, 30-day and recent, with these different lines here, levels of use continuing to go down.", "This would be the Reagan and Bush administration down here. We see dramatic increases here in use among our young people, in drug abuse and use among our young people. This is about the time Clinton appointed Joycelyn Elders, who sent the ``just say maybe'' message, as our chief health officer. It is the time, if we took these other charts and transposed them on here, that we cut the source country programs, so we had this incredible influx of heroin, cocaine, other illegal narcotics coming in, a tremendous increase in supply, decrease in price and availability, and the wrong message being sent. This is exactly what we got.", "I had another chart that was done. This is a smaller chart. I do not know if this chart can be seen here. But this is heroin trends in annual percentage. Actually it starts in 1975. We can see how this heroin use, annual use here, starts going down. This is eighth grade through 12th grade. We see it going down here, and then we see it levelling off in the eighties and in the nineties.", "Then we come to 1992, the election. We see the change in the drug policy. We see it being closed down, the war on drugs; again, the money being slashed in source country programs, the money being slashed in interdiction, stopping drugs coming into our borders. This is one of the most dramatic charts that I have seen produced, but it shows us going off the charts with illegal narcotics.", "Then arrive the Republicans in 1995, and through the leadership of the current Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), he chaired the subcommittee and had the responsibility for restoring our national drug policy.", "What was interesting, as I served in the Congress during this time, from 1992 when I was elected and the Clinton administration took over to 1995, when we took over, I believe, and I served on the Committee on Government Operations which had that drug policy responsibility and oversight responsibility, there was one hearing. It lasted for about 1 hour. They brought in the drug czar at the time.", "Again, this was after they had fired people. There were 120 people working in the drug czar's office. In 1993 they fired about 100 of them and left approximately 20. Again, the results are there in black and white. This is not a partisan issue, these are not partisan statistics. In fact, these charts and statistics, the information is provided by Clinton and U.S. officials under this administration. But it is pretty dramatic, when you close down the war on drugs, when you change the message that is being sent there, when you slash the resources from some of the cost-effective programs.", "One of the things they did was they shifted their emphasis almost all to treatment. If we take 1992 and 1993 to 1998, we would see almost a doubling in the amount of money for drug treatment. There is nothing wrong with treatment. Of course we need effective treatment programs. That is the subject of additional hearings and investigation which we will be doing, because if we are spending these huge amounts of money on treatment programs and prevention programs, we want to make certain they are effective. But this is very startling, factual information of what has taken place.", "Now, this policy has had some implications. Fifty-one percent of high school students said the drug problem is getting worse. This is in a survey within the last year. For the fourth straight year, both middle and high school students say drugs are their biggest concern.", "Also from the most recent survey, for the third straight year, the number of high school teens who report that drugs are used, sold, and kept at their school has risen from 72 percent in 1996 to 78 percent in 1998. Teenage drug use, again, the result of a failed policy. That is pretty evident.", "Today 50 percent of teens who smoked marijuana cited their friends as most influential, 30 percent cite themselves as most influential in deciding whether or not to use drugs. At age 13, teenagers get to know other students who use and sell pot, acid, cocaine, or heroin, and learn where to buy these drugs and who to buy them from. Forty-seven percent of our 13-year-olds say their parents have never seriously discussed the dangers of illegal drugs with them. We cannot entirely blame this on government, we have to take responsibility as parents.", "But the interesting statistics are, again, what has taken place with a change of Federal policy since 1992. We have almost doubled each year since 1992 the use of illegal narcotics by 12- to 17-year-olds. I have the exact statistics. In 1992, the increase was 5.3 percent. In 1994 it jumped to 8.2 percent. It was either 9, 10, or 11 percent for every year, an increase.", "So from 1992, with the change in the Clinton policy, to 1998, there has been a doubling of illegal narcotics use among our teenagers almost every single year. What should be of concern to all the Members of Congress is that illegal narcotics does affect our young people, but it also affects our minorities.", "A 1998 household survey on drug abuse found the percentage of blacks using drugs rose 8.2 percent in 1998 from 5.8 percent in 1993. So our minorities have been the recipients of a great deal of the problems in increases; particularly among, again, our minorities who are using drugs in almost double the statistics before 1993.", "Drug use among Hispanics rose to 6.1 percent from 4.4 percent from 1993 to 1998; another legacy of a change in policy brought about by this administration.", "Drug use since 1989 has increased among young adults 18 to 25 to its highest level, and that was in 1998. Drug use among 18 to 25 year olds increased about 10 percent from 1997 to 1998, again startling figures about increases in the use of illegal narcotics, particularly among our young people.", "The use of illegal narcotics is not just a problem among our young people. Today about 78 million Americans have used illegal drugs at some point in their lives. Roughly 13.6 million Americans are current users. Right now, marijuana is the most commonly used drug among our Nation's 13.6 million illicit drug users. It has also been recently revealed by another survey that an estimated 4.1 million people met diagnostic criteria for drug dependence on illicit drugs in 1997 and 1998, including 1.1 million use; that is about 25 percent of those who are dependent on illegal drugs are young people between 12 and 17.", "Additionally tonight, I wanted to spend a few minutes talking not only about the impact of illegal narcotics, some of the problems that I have cited, but also talk about some of the failures of the Clinton policy as it relates to stopping illegal narcotics coming into our country. As I cited just a few minutes ago, we know where most of the heroin, we know where most of the cocaine, we know where most of the methamphetamines are coming from. They are produced now in Colombia. They transit through Mexico. Mexico has also turned into a producer. Colombia produces 70 percent of all of the heroin. Six years ago it produced almost no heroin. There were almost no poppies grown in Colombia. Again, through the failed policy of this administration, Colombia has mushroomed into the drug producing capital of the world; actual producers of heroin, poppy, the core material. Mexico now is producing 14 percent of the heroin coming into the United States, that was in single digits some 6 or 7 years ago, under the Clinton administration.", "Probably 70, 80 percent of all of the illegal narcotics coming into the United States now come in from these two sources. As I cited, these two countries have not properly been dealt with by the United States. We certified Mexico, and Mexico in the last year has had a dramatic, over 50 percent decrease, in seizures of cocaine and dramatic decreases in seizures of heroin, and they were certified as cooperating.", "Mexico also promised, and the United States Congress asked Mexico to cooperate with the extradition, according to a 1978 extradition treaty, Mexican nationals who were indicted in the United States and we request their extradition should come back to the United States and fear coming back to the United States for trial on those charges. Not one major Mexican drug lord has been extradited to date. This Congress passed a resolution several years ago asking, in addition to extradition, that Mexico sign a maritime agreement. We know the drugs are coming in across land and around the waters that surround Mexico and the United States. To date, Mexico has not signed a maritime agreement.", "We further asked that Mexico allow our handful of DEA agents, law enforcement agents that are working in Mexico, to arm themselves and protect themselves since the death and murder of one of our agents, Kiki Camarena. To date, Mexico still has not complied with that simple request.", "We asked that Mexico also enforce laws that it had passed. They passed laws dealing with money laundering and illegal narcotics, and drug trafficking, but they do not enforce it.", "Rather than enforce the laws, as our simple request to work with the United States, what Mexico has done has actually become the capital of drug laundering. In fact, the largest drug laundering case in the history of the United States, if not the history of the world, was uncovered in a United States Customs operation which I cited and talked a little bit about in my last talk and this is a bit of the background on Operation Casa Blanca. It was an investigation that was concluded in May of 1998 with the indictment of 109 individuals and three Mexican banks. The undercover operation was the largest sting operation in the United States history. Because there are so many corrupt individuals involved in Mexico law enforcement and government, we did notify the Mexicans of some of what was going on, but not all of what was going on.", "After it became known that these individuals were involved at these various levels and that we had this sting operation going on, rather than cooperate with the United States what the Mexican officials did was threaten to arrest United States officials and Customs officials who were involved in this sting operation.", "I must say that I am pleased that the United States Customs agency, the Department of Justice, the FBI and others have moved forward. These individuals have been indicted where they are found in the United States. There are several who have fled and several who we requested extradition on who have not been returned to face justice in the United States, but my point here is that this United States Congress, the House of Representatives, asked Mexico to cooperate in stopping illegal narcotics activities and enforcing laws that were put on the books in extradition, which I cited, and some of these other things that I cited, and rather than assist the United States they blocked the United States. Only because of the visit of the President of the United States and because this had gotten so much publicity have they finally backed off.", "But this is the type of lack of cooperation. What is astounding is Mexico has been the recipient of one of the finest and most generous trade agreements of any two Nations, the NAFTA agreement, in which the United States gave very specific trade benefits to Mexico and asked very little in cooperation. We asked for their certification as cooperating and, for these trade benefits, a little bit of assistance in the illegal narcotics problem. What we have gotten basically is sand kicked in our face.", "Forty Mexican and Venezuelan bankers, businessmen, and suspected drug cartel members were arrested, and 70 others have been indicted as fugitives. This, again, is something that we have had to deal with ourselves and enforce ourselves without the cooperation of Mexican officials.", "It is my hope that we can turn this situation around, that Mexico can become a better partner in fighting illegal narcotics.", "I might say that, as I close this evening that Mexico is now becoming the recipient of much of the crime and violence. They have lost several of their States, the Baja peninsula is now lost to narco-traffickers. The Yucatan Peninsula, its Governor fled. He was involved up to his eyeballs in illegal narcotics.", "Other States along the United States border and within the heart of Mexico are now on the verge of collapse and being lost to drug traffickers.", "Mexico is now the recipient of some of the problems that we have inherited as a neighbor and friend and ally, and we only ask cooperation.", "Finally, as we close, it is nice to bring up some of the critical elements of what this administration has done. The positive aspects are the Republican-dominated Congress has restored funds for international programs. We have put back the Coast Guard, the military, and other Federal agencies and are now utilizing every possible resource. We have instituted an education program which is funded with over $190 million plus that amount matched by the private sector on which, this Thursday, our Subcommittee of Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources will do its first review.", "We hope that through education, through interdiction, through source country programs, through prevention and through treatment, through a multifaceted approach, this was started under Ronald Reagan, we can again bring down the problem of illegal narcotics, of drug use among our young people, the death and tragedy that it has caused in so many lives.", "With that, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to conclude my special order tonight on the continuing problem we face as a Congress and the American people with illegal narcotics."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/10/12/H9892_impact-of-illegal-narcotics-in-america/"}
