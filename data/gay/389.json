Matthew Shepard, the 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming who was described by a family member as an incredibly caring person with a big heart, mind and soul, was lured Tuesday night from campus by two young men, driven a mile outside of town, bludgeoned with a blunt instrument and tied to a fence like a dead animal. Close to death, with his head battered and burn marks on his body, he was discovered 12 hours later by two passing cyclists who at first said they mistook his unconscious body for a scarecrow. Today, as we deliberate here, young Matthew Shepard is lying in a coma, clinging to life.', u'Why was this young man singled out for such a barbaric act of violence? According to all accounts, he was attacked simply because he was gay. This is the latest in a series of brutally violent crimes committed against people for no other reason than the color of their skin, their sexual orientation or their religion.', u'For example, in southern Virginia last year, a soft-spoken black man was soaked in gasoline, burned alive, and then beheaded in the yard of his slayer. The victim was the only son of his parents, who were incredibly proud of his service in the Marines. He was targeted for this act of violence, it was discovered, simply because he was black.', u'Likewise in April 1994, two African American men murdered a white father of three in Lubbock, Texas. The killers later stated that they had set out to find a victim this time who was white.', u"Earlier this year in Illinois, a Hispanic family mourned the loss of their son who was kicked and verbally abused as he lay on the ground bleeding to death, shortly after being in a car accident with the assailant. According to the authorities, the driver of the other car was upset that his car had been damaged and went over to the victim and repeatedly kicked him in the stomach while shouting, ``Mexican, go back to Mexico.''", u'And all of us by now have heard about the recent slaying in Texas of James Byrd, a disabled black man. The Nation was horrified to hear the account of Mr. Byrd who was offered a ride by three young men in a pickup truck. After luring him into their vehicle, buying him beer and driving him to a remote location, the men beat Byrd unconscious, chained him to their truck and dragged him around until he was beheaded.', u'Incidents like these underscore the need for Congress to move forward and pass pending hate crime legislation sponsored by my colleague from Florida (Mr. McCollum). We have a responsibility as lawmakers and as human beings to do everything in our power to punish those who commit hate crimes of any kind to the fullest extent of the law. But it is equally important for us to speak out loudly against those individuals and organized groups like neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and skin-head sects which target people based on benign traits like skin color, sexual orientation or religion.', u'Today we should all keep Matthew Shepard and his family and his friends in our prayers as we reflect on this brutal act of violence. If we are in fact to survive as a society, we have got to come to grips with these horrible, horrible crimes that are being committed around us, and we have got to teach our children different, we have got to set examples.', u'The two young couples that disposed of the body of a baby in a trash can as they celebrated their evening prom continue to underscore how terribly weak we are becoming as a Nation and how careless we are becoming with facts and how we are not protecting each other from these types of acts of violence.', u'So, again I urge my colleagues to speak forcibly on this floor about protecting every human being on this earth. And we may have our differences, we may disagree on a lot of things, but to witness these kind of crimes being repeated and repeated and repeated, and allow them to go unchallenged, and allow it to be, well, because he was different, or that just happened because he was hanging out around the wrong types of people. Even the characterization of a legislator several years ago when he said, homosexuals are like gay bulls; they are worthless and should be sent to the packing plant. When legislators and people of authority start talking about other people like that, you wonder what impact it may have on average Americans who are sitting, listening.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/11/H10530-4_the-need-for-hate-crime-legislation/'}
