He has successfully fused his life as a religious leader and a Jewish mentor together with his commitment to a life of civic engagement and Tikkun Olam, or repairing the world. Throughout his years of service, Rabbi Davidson has effectively transcended the walls of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck in Nassau County, New York, establishing himself as an inspirational leader for both his congregation and community.', u"Jerome Davidson joined Temple Beth-El, a member congregation of the Union for Reform Judaism, as an assistant rabbi in 1958, and became its senior rabbi in 1971. Rabbi Davidson soon impressed the congregation with his dynamic sermons, driven enthusiasm and compelling sense of humor. Rabbi Davidson's brilliance and erudition were key in shaping the congregation's future. The educational opportunities presented by the Temple's comprehensive library and historical museum were central to Rabbi Davidson's success in teaching his congregants. Under his devoted tutelage, Temple Beth-El grew to become a thriving beacon of Jewish life in Great Neck; an arena of countless Bnai Mitzvah, weddings, other life-cycle events and social affairs.", u"Rabbi Davidson also laid the foundations of a successful Religious School and Early Childhood Education Center that addressed the needs of the diversified and growing congregation. Rabbi Davidson's exceptional creativity and boundless imagination confirmed Temple Beth-El, with its impressive membership of over 1200 families, as one of the most innovative and energetic Reform congregations in America. His uncoupled wisdom and unbridled inspiration served as a source of strength and encouragement in the aftermath of a devastating fire that struck the Temple in 1991.", u"Rabbi Davidson's steady rise to Jewish national iconography is no surprise considering the unique leadership qualities he demonstrated in serving Temple Beth-El. Rabbi Davidson's service as President of the Synagogue Council of America, as well as past president of the Rabbinic Alumni Association of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion only cemented Rabbi Davidson as a true Jewish leader.", u"Madam Speaker, Rabbi Davidson's commitment to Reform Judaism informed and complemented his involvement in pluralism and social justice. Rabbi Davidson's multiple terms as President of the Great Neck Clergy Association, and his groundbreaking efforts in developing interfaith dialogue, have served to better the lives of those around him, successfully realizing his lofty goals of building a community of tolerance and understanding. Rabbi Davidson's exemplary interfaith achievements, coupled with his involvement as a founding member of the American Jewish World Service, led the New York Board of Rabbis to honor him ``Rabbi of the Year'' in 1994.", u"More recently, Rabbi Davidson has been a trailblazer in formally welcoming the gay and lesbian community into Jewish life. He has likewise advocated for religious pluralism in Israel. Today, Rabbi Davidson continues to serve on the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and as a member of its Board of Governors. Rabbi Davidson also serves on the Advisory Board of the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, and is deeply involved in a plethora of other local and national Jewish organizations. Rabbi Davidson's adept ability for translating his values into action by positively affecting the world around him is truly an inspiration to all of those whose lives he has touched.", u'Madam Speaker, the accolades bestowed upon Jerome Davidson for his almost 50 years of outstanding service to the Long Island community are well deserved. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring Rabbi Jerome Davidson for his outstanding work and wishing him many more years of success as he becomes Rabbi Emeritus of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck, New York.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/06/11/E1256-3_in-recognition-of-rabbi-jerome-davidson/'}
