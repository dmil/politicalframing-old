Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.', u'On February 12, 2008, Lawrence King, an eighth grader in Ventura County, CA, was shot at school allegedly for being gay. He was known by classmates as an outcast who often came to school in high heels, jewelry, and makeup. He had come out just weeks before the shooting. King was working in a computer lab along with 20 other students that day when, witnesses say, 14-year-old classmate Brandon McInerney approached Lawrence and shot him in the head with a handgun. King was rushed to a local hospital where he was later declared brain dead. Once the victim died, prosecutors charged McInerney with murder as a premeditated hate crime and gun possession. He will be tried as an adult.', u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/02/25/S1115-2_the-matthew-shepard-act/'}
