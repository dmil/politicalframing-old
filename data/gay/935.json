Soon after this Congress began, an auto industry nearly imploded, and within a year an oil well exploded. It was a tough 2 years for our Nation and for so many families. It was also a time of remarkable progress.", "When this Congress began, insurance companies were free to deny health care to the sick for any excuse they could come up with. The doughnut hole that sent seniors' prescription drug costs through the roof was wide open. Wall Street firms had just crashed our economy, but they were still free to rip off investors while the Nation smoldered.", "Cigarette companies could prey on children, credit card companies could prey on consumers, and con artists could prey on families' mortgages.", "Employers were free to pay women less than men, the safety of our food supply was dangerously inadequate, and the definition of a hate crime was shamefully insufficient. Gay men and women who volunteered to defend and die for our country were asked to fight and die for values and principles they didn't have for themselves in America.", "More than a year has passed since American inspectors were on the ground to monitor the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal.", "We have turned each of these around. Because of what we did in this Congress, we brought the economy back from the brink of collapse, we cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, we invested in important job-creating projects, and we will keep working until everyone who wants to work can find a job.", "Because of what we did, families are safer from health insurance companies. Our economy and its investors are safer from big banks. Consumers are safer from credit card companies, homeowners are safer from mortgage fraud, and all of us are safer from corporate fraud.", "Parents can know their children are safer from cigarette companies, thanks to legislation we passed that will save lives. Our food safety protections will save countless more lives.", "We also made historic strides for equality and justice. With a hate crimes bill that bears Emmitt Till's name, we stood up for those who are victims of violence because of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. With a fair pay bill in Lilly Ledbetter's name, we stood up for those who are targets of discrimination in the workplace because of their gender or background. And we made right a wrong done long ago to African Americans and American Indian farmers.", "Because we repealed don't ask, don't tell, our military is stronger and we can still fulfill our Nation's promise. And because we ratified the START treaty today, America and the world are safer from nuclear devastation.", "These are just the ones that got the biggest headlines. The 111th Congress did much more.", "We cut taxes for the middle class and small business multiple times. We made it easier for families to buy their first home. We made it easier for students to afford to go to college, and strengthened our commitment to research, math and science education, technological innovation, and maintaining this country's competitive edge. We made sure children can afford to get the health care they need no matter how much money their parents make, and made sure even more schoolchildren who would otherwise go hungry can get healthier meals.", "We extended unemployment insurance for millions still struggling to find a job and extended COBRA subsidies so those still struggling to find work can feed their families, fuel our economy and afford decent medical care. We strengthened Medicaid and made sure doctors can still afford to treat seniors on Medicare. We helped hundreds of thousands afford more fuel-efficient cars and trucks.", "With a national service bill named for Senator Ted Kennedy, we made it easier for more Americans to serve their country, like our heroes of generations past. With one of the most important conservation bills in decades, we protected our public lands for generations to come. We cut waste and fraud in the way the Pentagon purchases military weapons. We made sure our troops have the equipment they need on the battlefield and that our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We gave everyone in the military a well-deserved pay raise.", "We secured our borders with guards, fencing, and predator drones. We imposed sanctions on Iran to deter this regime from acquiring a nuclear weapon. We thawed our credit markets so Americans can get the loans they need to buy a car, send a child to college, or even start a new business. We supported the travel and tourism industries, which will create tens of thousands of jobs and cut our deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars.", "We confirmed many well-qualified nominees for positions in public service and on the bench, including the third and fourth women--and the first ever Latina--to serve on our Supreme Court.", "We began this Congress with the challenge of keeping our economy from a second Great Depression. We are not all the way out of the ditch yet. We have come a long way since President Bush's Treasury Secretary sat down with us and warned us of the dire stakes of inaction.", "In 2011, we have to do even more to put middle-class families first, to create jobs and cut taxes. We will continue to move America toward energy independence. We will continue to fight to fix our broken immigration system. And we will continue fighting for fairness--including giving our first responders the same workplace rights everyone else has.", "This was, by far, the most productive Congress in American history. And the lameduck session we are finishing was the most productive of its kind. Why? Because we heard the message the American people sent us last month. They do not want us to sit around and waste our time. They want us to work together and work for them. They want us to get things done.", "We have been productive beyond any historical measure. But we cannot forget the context: We have had to do more with less--passing some of the most major pieces of legislation in history with the least bipartisan cooperation in history. I am sorry the minority party decided to sit on the sidelines. I know the history books will remember who was on the field.", "I thank every Senator and every staffer who has worked so hard. They have worked so tirelessly over these past 2 years. The distance we took America from January 2009 to December 2010 is one of the most remarkable times in the history of the world and our country.", "I am very proud of the work this Congress did, and I sincerely hope that, despite a divided Capitol, the 112th Congress will surpass only its record for significant legislation and not those for endless stalemates.", "I want to express my appreciation to this wonderful staff we have here. They work so very, very hard. They are here before we arrive in the morning, they are here after we leave, and I am grateful for all they do.", "The court reporters are here taking down every word that we say--very professional. The enrollment clerks. Everybody who is here. The Parliamentarians, whom we go to often to tell us the hole we are in and how to get out of it.", "I am grateful for everyone here for putting up with me and the hours I feel we have to work with never a complaint. I wish I had the ability to convey what is in my heart--and I certainly don't have the ability to do that--but I want everyone here to know that I am very grateful for everyone here working in such a wonderful manner for our country.", "I say to each one of you--I went through a long list of things we have been able to accomplish--we couldn't have done any of this without you. As much as I know about the rules, and I know quite a bit about the rules, I have to depend on the Parliamentarians to tell me--really, to get the real scoop. I admire what they do. They are very fine lawyers. This area of the law they know better than anyone else in the world.", "Madam President, I haven't mentioned the police officers, the doorkeepers. These police officers, they are here right now as we speak. Most all in the Chamber, of course, without uniform. We have people every day without any exception wanting to do bad things to this beautiful Capitol Complex. These wonderful police officers keep this building and its inhabitants, the people who work in this building--it is not inhabitants, although I feel I live here sometimes--they keep the thousands of people who work in these Capitol buildings safe. They do such a wonderful job of taking care of us.", "Chief Gainer, who is the Sergeant at Arms, is responsible for the police force. He does a wonderful job on this side of the Capitol.", "Madam President, I wish you, the Presiding Officer, my dear friend, and everyone here a very happy holiday season. I wish it could have been a little longer, but it is better than a lot thought it would be.", "I suggest the absence of a quorum."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/22/S11060-5_accomplishments-of-the-111th-congress/"}
