Many Americans simply did not know all West Virginia had to offer. However, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the people of West Virginia, we are opening our doors to show America and the world what all West Virginians know; our State has much to offer.", u'Since 1989, West Virginia has gone through a metamorphosis that has put the most beautiful butterfly to shame. We have invested $1 billion in computers for our classrooms, and placed them in modern schools that can handle the latest technology. Our roads and bridges are in the best shape in our history, our rural health program is considered a national model, and the public safety program is considered one of the best in the Nation.', u"And, Mr. Speaker, we are proud of our accomplishments. We want all Americans, especially West Virginians who have left, to come home and take note of the progress we have made, as well as our plan for the future. That is why we are engaged in a statewide effort known as Homecoming '96.", u"Homecoming '96 is a celebration of West Virginia. It's the largest community effort ever undertaken in our State--a celebration of our heritage and our future. Under the direction of steering committee cochairs Senator Robert C. Byrd and country music superstar Kathy Mattea, Homecoming '96 has many exciting statewide events planned.", u'We are inviting old and new friends to return to West Virginia and experience the unparelled beauty and friendship we have to offer. We invite everyone to travel our highways and take part in our rich heritage.', u"Mr. Speaker, there are over 300 communities in West Virginia participating in Homecoming '96, 78 of which are in my district. These communities have planned many activities for all people of all ages. For example, in Bluefield, the Historic Railroad Association has planned a train excursion in Mercer County. In Huntington, the celebration of the city's 125 birthday will coincide will Homecoming '96 activities, and in my hometown of Beckley, a Labor Day weekend concert will take place.", u"1996 is the year the residents of West Virginia recognize each other for the tremendous accomplishments made in the past. We are excited to show the world just how beautiful the Mountain State really is. Whether it's skiing the white peaks or thundering down the great New River, West Virginia is a State with much to offer.", u"Many past and current residents of the State will be sporting attractive Homecoming '96 pins and bumper stickers to encourage all Americans to join us in the most wondrous of celebrations. Many of these people will be more than happy to lead you where the delicious smell of apple butter is being made or homemade pies being cooled.", u'I close by inviting my colleagues, present and past residents of West Virginia, as well as all Americans, to come home to West Virginia and join the festivities this summer.', u"Mr. Speaker, I ask that the names of the communities in the Third Congressional District participating in Homecoming '96 be entered into the record: Alderson, Ansted, Athens, Ballard, Barboursville, Beckley, Big Creek, Bluefield, Boomer, Bramwell, Brenton, Buckeye, Camden on Gauley, Caretta, Ceredo, Chapmanville, Crumpler, Danville, Delbarton, Diana/Jumbo, Durbin, Fayetteville, Fort Gay, Frankford, Gary, Gauley Bridge, Gilbert, Greenbrier, Greenville, Hacker Valley, Hamlin, Hanover, Hinton, Huntington, Itman, Jodie, Jumping Branch/Nimitz, Kenova, Kermit, Kopperston, Lansing, Lerona/Speedway, Lewisburg, Lindside, Logan, Madison, Marlinton, Matewan, Matoaka, Maxwelton, Meadow Bridge, Milton, Montgomery, Mullens, Nemours, Northfork, Oak Hill, Oakvale, Oceana, Pence Springs, Peterstown, Pineville, Pipestem, Princeton, Prosperity, Rainelle, Renick, Ronceverte, Smithers, Sophia, Spanishburg, Summerslee, Summersville, Sylvester, Talcott, Union, War, Webster Springs, Welch, West Logan, West Virginia State Fair, White Sulpher Springs, Whitesville, Williamsburg, Williamson, and Wolf Creek."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/07/11/E1246-2_celebrating-west-virginias-heritage-homecoming-96/'}
