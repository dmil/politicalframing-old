Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.', u"Early in the morning of September 9, 2007, a gay man was walking home when he was attacked near the Georgetown University campus. According to the victim, two men at a college party began following him while yelling homophobic slurs. As the victim turned a corner, one of the men began punching him in the head, resulting in cuts and bruises to his face, and a broken thumb. The victim immediately reported the incident to the Georgetown campus police. The attack was investigated as a bias-related crime based on the victim's sexual orientation and the circumstances of the attack. However, the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department has charged Philip Cooney, a 19-year-old Georgetown sophomore, with simple assault.", u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/04/16/S3071_the-matthew-shepard-act-of-2007/'}
