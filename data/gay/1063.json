I ran a HH Sermon Seminar for the So. Cal. Board of Rabbis this year--my advice to all of them 3 weeks ago was--``Don't talk about it.'' Since then almost daily someone has called or come up to me and asked, ``What do I tell my kids, Rabbi?'' ``Where are they supposed to look for moral leadership?'' Like most of you my mind has been on information overload this week. I felt like the woman who once wrote about an overwhelming day in her life. She said, ``The washing machine broke down, the telephone kept ringing incessantly, the mail carrier brought a bill I had to no money to pay. Almost to the breaking point, I lifted my one-year-old into his highchair, leaned my head against the tray, and began to cry. Without a word, my tiny son took his pacifier out of his mouth . . . and stuck it in mine!'' I could have used that pacifier all week, as I kept thinking about something Rabbi Milton Steinberg, one of the great rabbis of the 20th century once said--``When I was young, I admired clever people. Now that I am older, I admire kind people.'' This has certainly not been a kind week--not for Ms. Lewinsky; not for the President or his wife or his child, not for the country; not for anyone. In fact, in many ways it seems to have brought out the worst of human nature--meanness of spirit, vindictiveness, derision, humiliation. ``The worst'' because as British philosopher Bertrand Russell once noted, ``Nobody ever gossips about other people's secret virtues.'' Parents tell me everyday that they are loath to open a newspaper, listen to the radio or watch the television for fear of what they might find. We have become victims of our own technological wizardry--caught up a whirlwind of sex, lies and videotape. A media feeding frenzy to have everything about everyone sent everywhere, instantly--it is the information age run amuck. But I see this communal trauma we are going through as one of our nation's great ``teachable moments.'' There are so many truly important lessons that we can learn and teach our children if we are open and willing. Lesson number one might be this: ``Just because we can, doesn't mean we should.'' I fear we are becoming a society without boundaries, without restraint, without respect, without a public moral sense of decency, or compassion or human dignity. It's as if our hierarchy of values has been turned on its head--as if ``truth'' for its own sake is the highest value in life. And so on this Jewish New Year it is worth remembering, that the 4,000 years of Jewish ethical tradition teach something quite different. For Judaism the highest value is not truth, it is the sanctity and dignity of human life itself. We ground our values in the commitment that human life is sacred--that the Torah teaches every human being is created in the divine image, with a spark of the divine within. You see, in Judaism the way we fulfill our destiny as human beings, is to find ways of getting that divine light within each of us to shine brighter and brighter because of what we do or what we say. And every time we do or say anything that diminishes that inner light in another human being, by trashing their image or reputation in the world, even if what we are saying is true, we are committing one of Judaism's gravest sins. My God, look at the society we seem to have created--it's the tabloidization of America, where even Heraldo Rivera can't compete anymore with the daily sleaze of Jerry Springer, one of the most popular shows on television; and the Kings of the radio waves are shock jocks who specialize in personal attacks and public humiliation. That is why I so desperately want us to seize this moment as an opportunity to remember who we are--who we can be--who we must be. To remember perhaps the core, fundamental ethical value of the Torah--for we have forgotten to teach our children and remind ourselves the all-important truth that what we say really matters. It is written simply and powerfully in the book of Proverbs: ``Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'' Do you realize that in all of the Talmud, in all of Jewish ethics after taking a life, the most serious sin in our entire tradition is the public humiliation of another human being? (2 X) It is what the Talmud calls, LASHON HARA--THE EVIL TONGUE, and it includes not only gossip and slander, but all words that are hurtful--any speech that damages the reputation or lowers the status of another. And it's the most widespread sin there is. In a remarkable insight into the human psyche the Talmud teaches, ``Many are guilty of stealing, fewer are guilty of sexual misconduct, but everyone commits the sin of slander; of Lashon Hara to some degree almost every day.'' That's why Rabbi Yosi ben Zimra created a fictional lecture which God delivers to our tongues: ``What else could I have done to rein you in, to control you?'' God begs the tongue. ``Though all other human limbs stand up, you lie flat.'' Though all other limbs are external and visible, I hid you inside the body, I enclosed you behind two walls, one of bone and one of flesh and even so no matter I do you still do more damage than anything else I have ever created.'' Today is Yom Hazikaron the Day to Remember--remember what? Remember who we are. Remember that we think we are human beings having a spiritual experience, when we are really spiritual beings having a human experience. Do you know that Jewish law commands us not to allow the body of even a convicted murderer to hang on the gallows over night? This Mitzvah is dramatized in a famous Midrash which tells the story of twins--one who becomes the King and the other becomes a thief and murderer. The thief is caught, convicted, sentenced to death and hanged in the Town Square. And as the body hangs limp for all to see, strangers who pass by not knowing what happened look at it and what do they think? The King is hanging from the gallows. For the Rabbis, God is the King--and we are God's twins. That is why even the worst human being; one who sheds another's blood is accorded dignity and respect. Because every one of us from the lowest to the highest has within the same Divine light. For Jewish wisdom knew that even the truth can be evil-- lashon hara--if it is used to cause pain, disgrace and humiliation. Jewish ethics teach us that just because something is true, doesn't mean we must say it--it is the intention of our words that matter most. We have lost our moral balance--from political sound-byte attack ads to Hard Copy to what passes for the nightly news-- we have cheapened life itself; nothing is private, nothing is sacred. ``Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'' Remember Richard Jewell who helped save lives when the bomb went off in the Olympic Park in Atlanta? His life went from Hero to horror overnight--because we have lost the sense of boundaries, and knowing itself has become our highest value regardless of who is hurt as a result. You probably don't remember Oliver Sipple. He was the ex- Marine who became a hero overnight by saving then President Ford's life when he grabbed the arm of Sarah Jane Moore as she pointed a gun at the President. Her aim was deflected and the bullet went astray. Reporters came to interview him and he had only one request: ``Don't publish anything about me.'' Right! Tell that to an investigative reporter. Within days the LA Times, followed by dozens of other papers trumpeted the news that Sipple was active in gay causes in San Francisco. A reporter in Detroit confronted his mother, who knew nothing about his homosexuality, with the news. She was stunned, and stopped speaking to her son. When she died four years later, his father informed Sipple that he wouldn't be welcome at her funeral. Devastated, he began to drink heavily, and a few years later was found in his apartment--dead at age forty-seven. ``Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'' This is what Jewish tradition calls, Avak Lashon Hara-- ``The Dust of the Evil Tongue''--and it is settling all around us. So when people asked me, ``What do I tell my kids?'' I say don't tell your kids, teach your kids. And what can we teach our children at this New Year--even knowing that tomorrow morning hour after hour of the President's taped testimony will be broadcast over the nation's airwaves? That the Talmud says ``You can kill a person only once, but when you humiliate him, you kill him many times over.'' This we can teach our children. What else can we teach our children? ``If you mess up it is tempting to tell a lie, but people will usually be much more angry about the lie than the original act itself. This we can teach our children. What else can we teach our children? In the end, growing up means the willingness to accept personal responsibility for our own actions. This we can teach our children. What else can we teach our children? We transgress in a moment; we regret for a lifetime. Repentance and forgiveness take work and time--sometimes the work of a lifetime. This we can teach our children. What else can we teach our children? It's not how many times you fall down that ultimately matters in life--it's how often you get up again that counts. This we can teach our children. Arrogance, jealousy, temptation are as old as time. From nearly every Biblical hero to our own lives. After all, how many of you can think of at least one episode in your life that would cause you great embarrassment were it to becomes known to everyone else here? This, too we can teach our children. And above all, don't look out there for moral heroes--to politics, or sports, musicians or actors or celebrities--You are your children's primary moral models, and you must be their moral heroes. So teach your children respect. Teach your children restraint. Teach your children by how you talk and the jokes you do or don't tell; the snickering or respectful tone of your voice, the dignity you extend to others. Teach your children that the highest value isn't always truth--it may in fact be kindness. One cold evening during the Holiday Season, a little boy about six or seven was standing out in front of a store window in New York City. The little boy had no shoes to speak of and his clothes were nothing more than rags. A young woman passing by saw the little boy and the condition he was in, so she took him by the hand and led him into the store. She bought him some shoes and warm clothes and told him she hoped he'd have a better holiday season now. The little boy looked up at her and asked, ``Are you God, Ma'am?'' She laughed and replied, ``No son, I guess I'm just one of God's children.'' And as the little boy turned to walk away, he smiled and said, ``I knew you had to be some relation.'' That's who we really are. It's Rosh Hashana, and a new year lies ahead. A New Year filled with infinite possibilities for change and growth, forgiveness and kindness and love. So teach your children the wisdom of Rabbi Nahman of Bratzlov who said, ``If you are not going to be any better tomorrow than you are today, than what need have you for tomorrow?''"], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/13/E2112_rabbi-steven-carr-reuben-on-rosh-hashana/'}
