Jacobs for his invaluable service to the residents of the San Fernando Valley and to people throughout the world. For the past 36 years, Rabbi Jacobs has provided an unwavering commitment to civil rights and religious pluralism. This year, Rabbi Jacobs will be retiring from his position as Senior Rabbi of Temple Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills, California. He leaves behind a legacy that exemplifies tikkun olam, the repair and healing of the world.', u"For many years, Rabbi Jacobs has worked to promote social justice and inter-faith and interracial relations. In 1999, he accompanied Reverend Jesse Jackson on an interfaith delegation to Yugoslavia. That delegation sought the release of captured American soldiers. When asked whether it was difficult to balance his spiritual beliefs with his personal feelings and political opinions, the Rabbi commented: ``It is in our life as religious leaders to hold hands, even with people who are our enemies.''", u'Rabbi Jacobs demonstrates the powerful impact that people of faith can have on our society through an unrelenting commitment to the protection of religious and civil rights for all people. He was honored in 2001 with the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award, presented for his efforts to promote and preserve religious liberty.', u"Rabbi Jacobs has served as an influential member of the Progressive Jewish Alliance, the Southern California Board of Rabbis, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the UNICEF National Board, and the Muslim American Homeland Security Congress of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. He chaired the Governor of California's Task Force on Refugees and was a delegate to the United Nations' Conference on Refugees.", u'As part of his exemplary international work, Rabbi Jacobs participated in an interfaith delegation to El Salvador. He also served on a mission to Prague, Czech Republic, working in conjunction with the North American Board of Rabbis to improve Jewish-Catholic relations.', u'Rabbi Jacobs continues to fight racism against Muslims and to foster improved Muslim-Jewish relations in Los Angeles. In 2004, he collaborated with the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Anti-Defamation League to condemn terrorism. His efforts to denounce hate speech have allied him with the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, and many other similar organizations. I am pleased that he will continue his work through his most recent endeavor, the Rabbi Steven B. Jacobs Progressive Faith Foundation, whose vision is to promote the values of interfaith acceptance in the public and private sectors.', u'The Rabbi has also fought for wage reform to help ensure a living wage for all workers. He has also worked to mobilize the traditional coalition of African Americans and Jews to ensure fair and honest elections.', u"It is my honor to congratulate Rabbi Steven B. Jacobs for his noble career as Kol Tikvah's senior rabbi. His work has strengthened communities of faith, increased positive social action, and added to international understanding and cooperation. He has touched and improved the lives of people of all faiths not just in the San Fernando Valley but throughout the world."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/29/E1346-4_tribute-to-rabbi-steven-b-jacobs/'}
