As his friends, family and coworkers all gather to celebrate his farewell, I ask all my colleagues to join in honoring his community leadership and many remarkable accomplishments.", u"After Rabbi Bloom completed his BA in History from the University of Wisconsin and his Master's in Social Work from the University of Maryland, he realized his calling in life: the rabbinate. He began his career by serving as the Associate Rabbi at Congregation Beth Am in Los Altos Hills.", u"Following his service with the Congregation, Rabbi Bloom was Associate Rabbi at the Sinai Temple of Champaign-Urbana in Illinois. In 1995 he became the Senior Rabbi at Congregation B'nai Israel, where he has served with distinction for the past 11 years.", u"Rabbi Bloom has been a strong leader for B'nai Israel. He guided a devastated congregation and the greater Sacramento community through one of its darkest hours in June of 1999, when arsonists attacked three of Sacramento's synagogues, including his own.", u"Rabbi Bloom's calm, uniting voice emerged from the dense fog of hate and fear in the weeks and months following the attacks. He revived the community's spirits and helped bring forward a united front against hate. In order to build a dialogue, he helped create the Children of Abraham group, which brings together clergy and congregants of Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. And under his leadership, the synagogue opened its door to gay and lesbian Jews to perform commitment ceremonies inside the sanctuary.", u"Through it all Rabbi Bloom has been dedicated to cultivating a strong and thriving Jewish community. With his gifts as a teacher, he has shown a commitment to life-long learning and instilling that value in others. He has led adult education groups, including Talmud classes, Kabbalah courses and a women's book group. These unique programs have helped educate and unite the Jewish community.", u"Since 1995, Rabbi Bloom has been a strong voice for B'nai Israel, and helped foster compassion and understanding throughout our community. On behalf of the people of Sacramento and the Fifth Congressional District of California, I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking Rabbi Brad Bloom for his public service as we wish him success in his future endeavors."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/09/E1105-3_a-tribute-to-rabbi-brad-bloom/'}
