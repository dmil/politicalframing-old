For 125 years the Tribune has chronicled the African American story while also being an important part of that story.", "The Tribune was founded in 1884 by Christopher Perry only 19 years after the end of the U.S. Civil War. Perry, born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1856, moved to Philadelphia at the age of 17, intent on starting a newspaper. He said, ``For my people to make progress, they must have a newspaper through which they can speak against injustice.''", "Perry published the first edition of the Tribune Weekly when he was 28. To put the debut of the one-page and one-man operation newspaper in an historical context, that same year African American inventor Lewis Lattimer began working for Thomas Edison, Tuskegee Institute was founded by Booker T. Washington and Harriet Tubman was still alive. After Perry died in 1921, the leadership of the newspaper passed to his son-in-law, E. Washington Rhodes.", "From 1922 to 1970, Rhodes was at the helm of the newspaper as publisher. An attorney, Rhodes was also an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District, appointed by President Calvin Coolidge. He was the first Black to be appointed to that position. Additionally, he served as president of the National Bar Association; was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1938; and, was president of the National Publishers Association (NNPA), a national trade organization of African American owned newspapers.", "Over the past decades, committed to the newspaper's mission as stated by Perry, the Tribune has been led by Eustace Gay, John Saunders, Alfred Morris and Waverly Easley. And today, under the leadership of Chairman Walter Livingston, Jr., and President/CEO Robert Bogle, the Tribune newspaper continues to expand and has been the recipient of numerous national awards including the NNPA's John B. Russwurm Award for ``Best Newspaper in America Award and the A. Phillip Randolph ``Messenger Award.''", "President Bogle stresses that after 125 years the mission of the Philadelphia Tribune has not changed very much. ``For 125 years the Tribune has been the voice of those who would have been voiceless.'' And, for that reason today Madam Speaker, I salute the proud history, advocacy and courage of the Philadelphia Tribune. The Tribune is an historic trailblazer whose light continues to lead on the path to justice and equality for the voiceless."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/05/26/E959-2_a-tribute-to-the-philadelphia-prime-movers-program/"}
