One-hundred and twenty-five years ago, the Roswell Post Office opened its doors and a town's identity was established. Since that time, the residents of Roswell have displayed a hearty ``can-do'' attitude as they adapted to the constantly evolving economic climate of the region.", u'Roswell has served as an economic and educational hub for southeastern New Mexico. It has been a center for sheep ranching, cattle driving, space exploration, and military aviation. Today, Roswell supports a thriving dairy industry and, because of its warm winters and relaxed pace, it has become a popular retirement destination for senior citizens across the country. Roswell is the site of the New Mexico Military Institute, one of the finest military preparatory academies in the country, and many noteworthy figures such as Pat Garrett, Roy Rogers, Roger Stauback, and Nancy Lopez have called it their home.', u"Roswell has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a supply post. Throughout its history, it has exemplified the feisty optimism so typical of the American spirit. Roswell's 125 years of history and development merits a fitting celebration and recognition. I ask that the article entitled ``Roswell, Then and Now, An Overview'' which appeared in the August 16, 1998 Roswell Daily Record be printed in the Record.", u'The article follows:', u"Roswell's 125th birthday celebration actually commemorates the opening of the Roswell post office Aug. 20, 1873. While the settlement predated the post office by three of four years, there are no records to pin down exactly when the town was actually founded. It was called ``Roswell'' starting in the spring of 1872, but it took a while for the name to catch on. Mescalero Apaches had roamed this area for a long time, but the Pioneer Period in the history of Roswell and Chaves County actually started when the first permanent residents, who were Hispanic farmers and sheep ranchers, came about 1865 to start several area settlements, including Rio Hondo--that part of Roswell that today is called ``Chihuahuita.'' The Anglo cattlemen from Texas soon followed. Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving blazed the Goodnight-Loving Trail in 1866. John Chisum soon settled down here to become the ``Cattle King of the Pecos.'' By the mid-1870s, he was the largest cattle producer in the United States. The area around the confluence of the Rio Hondo and the Pecos River made an excellent spot for cattlemen to rest their herds. There was no supply post between Seven Rivers and Fort Sumner, so James Patterson built a little adobe trading post in what is now the 400 block of North Main Street. The future Roswell was born when Van C. Smith showed up about 1869 or '70 and enlarged Patterson's trading post into a hotel and built a store nearby to cater to the needs of drovers on the Goodnight-Loving Trail. Smith identified his place with the nearby Hispanic settlement of Rio Hondo. In the spring of 1872, however, he decided he needed a more exact address, so he started calling his place ``Roswell'' after his father. The Roswell post office operated in Smith's store 125 years ago, Aug. 20, 1873, and he was the first postmaster. He was too much of a gambler to develop the town. That job fell to Capt. Joseph C. Lea, ``The Father of Roswell.'' The Lincoln County War was going on about the time Capt. Lea arrived in 1877-78, but he pretty well kept it away from Roswell. The Army sent the now famous ``Buffalo Soldiers'' to protect the town. It was up to another Roswell man, Pat Garrett, to become sheriff of Lincoln County, put an end to the violence and hunt down Billy the Kid. The Developmental Period in Roswell and Chaves County's history dates from around 1890. Chaves County was created in 1889 and organized in 1891, the town of Roswell was incorporated in 1891, and artesian water was discovered in town in 1890. Also, New Mexico Military Institute was established in 1891. Before 1894, Roswell claimed to be farther from a railroad than any other town in the United States. The arrival of the Pecos Valley Railway changed that in 1894, which was an important turning point in the area's history--especially after it was extended to Amarillo in 1899. J.J. Hagerman was the one most responsible for both railroad developments. The impact of the railroad on the economic expansion of the city and county cannot be overstated. Many new settlers arrived, which meant new growth for Roswell--the first bank, the first newspaper, many other new businesses, the first schools and the first churches. The Maturing Period in the history of Roswell and Chaves County started around 1903 when Roswell was reincorporated as a city. Over the next several years, utilities and paved streets were developed. The Carnegie Library and the Roswell Country Club were established. The Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother came to Roswell and started St. Mary's Hospital in 1906. New Mexico finally became a state in 1912. In preparation for that, Chaves County built a new courthouse that was one of the largest buildings in the Southwest and still is one of the most beautiful public buildings in the state. Roswell's first airport was built in 1929, and the first radio station went on the air in 1931--KGFL. Roswell has been connected with several world-class athletes and entertainers. In the 1920s, local rancher/cowboy Bob Crosby became the ``King of the Cowboys'' when he won the Roosevelt Trophy for being world champion rodeo cowboy three years. Local musicians Louise Massey and the Westerners got their start here in 1928 and went on to become big country/western stars. Roy Rogers, the movies ``King of the Cowboys,'' used to hang out here back in the 1930s. His first wife was a 1932 graduate of Roswell High School, Arline Wilkins, whom he married here in 1936. Singer/composer John Denver was born at St. Mary's Hospital in Roswell in 1943. Clear skies and wide open spaces attracted Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the ``Father of Modern Rocketry,'' to Roswell in the 1930s. Here, he made man's first attempts to explore outer space. The Great Depression and the New Deal of the 1030s visited Roswell, and there are a number of monuments to show for it. For example, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) boys built Bottomless Lakes State Park--the first state park in New Mexico. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) built City Hall, Cahoon Park and Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge. The WPA also built schools, DeBremond Stadium and the Roswell Museum and Art Center. The museum opened in 1937 and has continued to grow. One of its most important collections is the Peter Hurd paintings. Peter Hurd, who was born in Roswell in 1904, was the greatest native son artist of New Mexico. The Military Period in Roswell's history dates from the early 1940s, to 1968, but Roswell has always done its part in our nation's military conflicts. National Guard Battery A, one of the oldest and most honored outfits in the state, had gone to the border back in 1916 when Pancho Villa invaded New Mexico; they also went to France in World War I, and were a major part of the infamous Bataan Death March in the early stages of World War II. Roswell's climate brought the U.S. Army here in the early 1940s to establish the Roswell Army Air Field, which after World War II became the home of the world's only atomic warfare unit, the 509th Bomb Wing and the ``Enola Gay'' B-29 bomber. The Orchard Park prisoner of war camp brought 4,800 Germans, some of whom made life-time friendships here and others came here to live after the war. New Mexico Military Institute in every war has produced a large portion of officers for the military. In July 1947, Lt. Walter Haut of the Roswell Army Air Field told the Roswell Daily Record--and the world--that the Army had captured a flying saucer that crashed on Mac Brazel's ranch near Corona, 75 miles north west of Roswell. Maj. Jesse Marcel saw the wreckage and said it was not of this world, but Gen. Roger Ramey insisted it was only a weather balloon! You couldn't tell that to Glen Dennis and others who not only saw the strange debris, but also saw some little gray bodies. Apparently, the federal government has been covering up the ``Roswell Incident'' story ever since. The International UFO Museum and Research Center is dedicated to learning the truth and has become Roswell's No. 1 tourist attraction. In January 1948, Roswell Army Air Field became Walker Air Force Base, an important link in the Strategic Air Command. In 1960 it was designated as a support base for a squadron of Atlas ICBMs. A dozen missile sites were built in a 25-mile radius of Walker. They were completed by the end of 1962, then deactivated by March 1965. The deactivation of the missile squadron was the first blow to the military economy of Roswell. The main calmaity was the closure of Walker, which took place June 30, 1967. Parts of Roswell became ghost towns as thousands made their exodus. Roswell's economy collapsed. The present Industrial Period started in 1967 with the conversion of Walker Air Force Base into the Roswell Industrial Air Center (RIAC). The former air base has seen the manufacture of many products, from fireworks, lollipops and Levis jeans to mobile homes and city buses--first by Transportation Manufacturing Corps and more recently by NovaBUS. Roswell Community College moved to the RIAC and used many of the former Air Force buildings for expanded vocational and academic-transfer programs, changing its name to Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell. The college added several new buildings over the years, and in the 1980s built a beautiful new campus for the booming school. An auxiliary landing strip several miles south of Walker was converted to civilian use as well, first as a school for retarded boys and as a minimum security prison--Roswell Correctional Center--since 1978. Other major economic developments in Roswell since 1967 include the influx of retirees, attracted by low living costs and warm weather. THe town has a continued a steady and prosperous growth. Many national chains have branches in Roswell, some of which have been around for a long time. Numerous others have come in the 1990s, so that national names are represented among the department stores, fast-food restaurants and motels. The trend toward modernization of business in Roswell was boosted by the opening of the Roswell Mall north of town in the 1980s. Over the years, several locals have achieved national fame on the fields of sport: such as Tom Brookshier, Pete Jaquess, Chick Smith, Nancy Lopez and the 1956 Little League World Champions. Dallas Cowboys football great Roger Staubach played at NMMI for a year in the early 1960s. Roswell, on the 125th birthday of its post office, is a city approaching 50,000 in population. There is no larger city within a radius of about 200 miles, so Roswell serves as a hub for southeast New Mexico. It is still small enough that traffic is not a big problem; and the business, educational, medical, legal, religious, fraternal and industrial communities provide for virtually all the needs of the folks in Roswell and the area. The next 125 years will no doubt see similar developments-- growth, problems, ups and downs--as these years since 1873 have witnessed. But the good folks of Roswell will be proud to live here and enjoy being a part of the Land of Enhancement!
