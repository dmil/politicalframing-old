But, another event took place on that day in and of itself that could have triggered the onset of this historic period, at least in the mind of Robert S. (Bobby) Reese, Jr., who was born on that day in Florence, South Carolina to ``Big Bobby'' and ``Gem'' Reese.", "Bobby worked here in Washington for more than 30 years representing the American Trucking Associations and the Altria Group. Many in this chamber have had the good fortune and pleasure to have shared much of that time with Bobby. During my tenure here, Bob has been a trusted advisor and personal friend. I, like many others in this august body, often partnered with Bobby on the golf course, and often shared with him the thrill of victory. Of course there were moments when Bobby and many of us experienced the agony of defeat. But I think that all of us will agree that he was always a reliable partner or tough competitor. And, at least with me, he never understood the phrase ``customer golf.''", "Bobby retired about 2 years ago and he and his lovely wife, Peggy, moved back to our home State and are enjoying their retirement in the Dunes West golf course community near Mount Pleasant. Bobby and Peggy are also enjoying spending more time with their four adult children: Patty, Cynthia, Taylor and Michael and two grandchildren Tayson and Senna.", "Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in wishing a happy and festive 60th birthday to Robert S. ``Bobby'' Reese, and our hopes that he, Peggy and all of the Reese family and friends will have a joyous occasion on August 6, 2005 and for many more years to come."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/07/22/E1577_tribute-to-robert-s-bobby-reese-jr/"}
