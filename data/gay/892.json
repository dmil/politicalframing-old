It goes like this, and I quote:", "``As President Clinton continues the bombing campaign over Kosovo, confusion abounds. Former `doves' are cheering but traditional `hawks' appalled by Mr. Clinton's command blunders, don't know what to say. Concerned Americans want to support the troops, but they are flummoxed by a President who is misusing authority over them.", "``To make sense of what is happening, it helps to recognize Mr. Clinton is not conducting a serious, traditional war. If he were, the first wave of NATO planes would have reduced the palace of Slobodan Milosevic, Rembrandt painting and all, to smoking smithereens.", "``The Kosovo operation is different and oxymoronic. It is a `peace war' waged by `peace hawks' pursuing a dovish social agenda. Peace hawks are global idealists and former anti-war activists, including the youthful Bill Clinton, who used to `loathe' the military because it uses lethal force. Now that he is commander in chief, Mr. Clinton can use the troops for more virtuous purposes.", "```Doing good' on a worldwide scale appeals to peace hawks, who are motivated by altruism, not patriotism. The sight of uniformed peacekeepers distributing food in faraway places makes their hearts sing. As columnist Paul Gigot wrote: `It's as if liberals feel better waging war when U.S. interests aren't at stake.'", "``The Kosovo peace war is all about good intentions and grand social objectives. President Clinton said so in a speech before a public employees' union on March 23, rambling on about a vision of `diversity, community, belonging, and wanting our neighbors to do well,' the President rhapsodized, `This is why I devoted so much time,' quoting the President, `to that initiative on race and why I keep fighting for passage of the Hate Crimes legislation, the Employment Nondiscrimination, gay rights legislation, all these things, because I am telling you look all over the world--that's what Kosovo is about. People are still killing each other out of primitive urges because they think what is different about them is more important than what they have in common,''' close quote.", "``Mr. Clinton conceded that the people of Yugoslavia had been battling off and on for hundreds of years, but exulting in his own enlightened insight, Mr. Clinton said, `It is an insult to them to say that somehow they were intrinsically made to murder one another.'", "``Deriding those who would say, `They're just that way' to excuse violence in Northern Ireland or misbehavior among children, the President added, `Well, if every parent said that, the jails would be five times as big as they are. That's not true. I just don't believe that. And I know what happened in Bosnia, where we found the unity and the will to stand up against the aggression, and we helped to end the war. And later, to make sure the peace would last, we agreed to send troops in with our allies. And I think it was a good investment.'", "``So there you have it--victory, as defined by Bill Clinton. Like a parent disciplining an unruly child, our peace-war commander in chief is saying to Kosovo, `Can't you just get along?' NATO is supposed to continue the bombing, in order to pacify warring factions in Serbia and Kosovo. The ultimate goal is to duplicate the edgy silence of Bosnia, and enforce it with NATO peacekeepers for years, perhaps for decades. This is the `it' we are `in', and there is no way Americans can win.", "``The entire operation was conceived and launched by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who once said to General Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, `What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?' General Powell wrote in his autobiography that Mrs. Albright's outburst, made during a briefing on Bosnia, almost gave him an aneurysm. The general tried to explain that `American GIs are not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global gameboard.'", "``But Mrs. Albright is finally getting her way, despite reported warnings from the current Joint Chiefs of Staff. Once again uniformed leaders are being ordered to make war and peace simultaneously.''", "As the late Army Gen. Creighton Abrams, Vietnam-era Chief of Staff used to say, ``Fighting in the name of peace is like seeking virtue in a bordello.''", "It is time to start over, before a bad situation gets worse. The deployment of land troops for combat--daintily described by Mrs. Albright as a ``nonpermissive environment''--will not bring peace to a Kosovo that no longer exists. Why not follow the president's lead, and do something to make everyone feel better about the situation?", "There are lots of creative ways to achieve the president's stated goals--diversity, community and belonging--without passing bad legislation or needlessly putting combat soldiers at risk. For starters, Mr. Clinton's Hollywood friends could stage a remake of that memorable soft-drink commercial--the one featuring a hillside of children folk-singing about apple trees, honey bees, and buying the world a Coke.", "With help, Balkan refugees could participate in the production. Perhaps the International Monetary Fund could take the $5 billion loan that Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov recently passed up, and divert it to Albania and other neighboring countries that are willing to provide clean clothes, food, and safe, temporary housing.", "Forget the usual presidential photo-ops with deployed soldiers in fatigues. Let Bill Clinton risk his own neck for a change. To burnish his legacy, he could fly into Belgrade on an Apache helicopter, and play the saxophone at one of those rock concerts. Even with bulletproof glass, it would make a great picture for the history books--just like the ones of John F. Kennedy in Berlin and Ronald Reagan at the Wall.", "Then the belligerent Balkan leaders could be flown back to the White House for some friendly attitude adjustment. They could even shake hands in front of a beaming president, arms outstretched in a striking freeze frame that would make everyone feel good. So all together now . . . let's join hands, light a candle, and sing ``Kumbaya.'' We can win the peace war in Kosovo. Just keep our soldiers out of it."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/04/15/H2105-2_peace-hawks-with-eyes-on-the-ground/"}
