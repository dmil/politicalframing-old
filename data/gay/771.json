The event honoring Senator Denton was hosted jointly by our colleague Senator DeWine of Ohio and Matthew:25 Ministries in Cincinnati, which operates a relief program for schools, orphanages, and clinics in Nicaragua.", "This amendment passed as a part of the Defense authorization bill on October 19, 1984. It allowed, for the first time, the shipment of humanitarian goods from non-profit groups free of charge on military planes on a space-available basis. These goods include school, medical, and agricultural supplies and range from hospital beds to pencils.", "Congress approved the legislation in order to resolve various legal questions involved in such shipments and in order to take advantage of unused space on military vessels in Central America in times of crisis. It has since been expanded to encompass most of the world, and to date, more than 10 million pounds of goods have been shipped to needy countries. In fiscal year 1995, the program was used to transport approximately 2 million pounds of humanitarian goods to 21 different countries. It is now known widely as the Denton Amendment Program. Senator Denton was a member of the Armed Services Committee while in the Senate.", "Groups such as Gay Construction of Decatur, AL, have used the program to ship 40,000 pounds of medical and school supplies to orphans in Albania. The Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi used it in March 1995 to send 4,000 pounds of medical supplies and clothing to a small village in the Honduras.", "Under the Denton program, the Department of Defense pays for the extra fuel used by its planes due to the heavier loads. The U.S. Agency for International Development pays for inspection costs, which are usually very small, and the Department of State monitors compliance of shipments to be certain they are consistent with American foreign policy initiatives.", "Senator Denton was once a Navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam on July 18, 1965. He spent 7\\1/2\\ years as a prisoner-of-war in a camp in Vietnam. He first received national attention during a 1966 interview his captors arranged with a Japanese television station. During this interview, he defied his captors' order to condemn American policy, saying he would support the U.S. Government's position as long as he lived. He also blinked the word ``torture'' in Morse code into the camera. The message, which was picked up by Naval intelligence officers, was the first confirmation that American POW's were being beaten and generally mistreated by the North Vietnamese. Senator Denton's ordeal was documented in his book, ``When Hell Was in Session,'' which was also made into a movie.", "As a military pilot and naval aviator, he had seen the poverty that existed in many countries, especially in Central America. He also knew that there was often empty space on cargo flights and that pilots often made ``dry runs'' in order to maintain their edge. When he put these facts together, the idea for his amendment came rather easily.", "I commend and congratulate former Senator Denton for his strong leadership roles in both the Armed Forces and in the U.S. Senate. I also salute him for the tremendous sacrifices he made for his country during the Vietnam war. The Denton Amendment Program is an outstanding example of how the concern and efforts of one individual can make a real difference in the world.

An act to control and prevent commercial counterfeiting, and for other purposes. H.R. 3029. An act to designate the United States courthouse in Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``E.
