Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. As was the case with Dr. Satcher's nomination to be Surgeon General, his nomination has been on the shelf, held by a ``hold'' at the request of only a few Senators. I will deal shortly with the reasons Jim Hormel's nomination has been stalled. But let me take just a few moments to review the history of the nomination and some of the facts about the nominee and his background.", "Last fall, following a hearing on his nomination, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve Jim Hormel's nomination by a vote of 16 to 2 at a business meeting on November 4, 1997. In point of fact, for those who were not present at the business meeting, the nomination was deemed a routine matter, and was approved by a voice vote, along with the rest of the committee's agenda of nominations and legislation for that day. No Senator spoke in opposition to the nomination. It was only after the meeting that two Senators asked to be recorded against the nomination, as was their right, which resulted in the final tally. Still, 16 to 2 is a strong endorsement by the Committee on Foreign Relations.", "The nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar, and, despite the fact that the Senate confirmed every other Foreign Relations Committee nominee before the close of the first session--some 50 nominees in total--Jim Hormel's nomination was left languishing because of ``holds'' placed on it by a few Senators.", "That such a distinguished and qualified nominee would face opposition is, on its face, hard to understand. Let me tell you a little about the Jim Hormel I have known for some 20 years now. He is, first and foremost, a loving and devoted father of 5, and a grandfather of 13. His entire family has been unfailingly supportive of his nomination. Anyone who has met him or knows him knows that he is decent, patient, and a very gentle person.", "His professional credentials are equally impressive. He is an accomplished businessman. He serves as chairman of the California investment firm, Equidex, and he serves as a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.", "He has also spent time as a successful lawyer and educator. He received his J.D. from the University of Chicago, one of our Nation's finest law schools, and he later returned there to serve as dean and assistant dean of students from 1961 to 1967. In addition, he currently serves as a member of the board of managers of his alma mater, Swarthmore College, another of our Nation's finest institutions of higher learning.", "Jim Hormel has also been a remarkably generous philanthropist and dedicated community activist. He has supported a wide variety of causes and organizations, but there has always been a common theme: bringing people together, resolving conflict, helping those who are in need, and making the surrounding community a more pleasant place in which to live.", "Even a sampling of the organizations he has supported is impressive in its breadth as well as its diversity. In addition to his support for Swarthmore and the University of Chicago, he has provided resources and assistance to the Virginia Institute of Autism, Breast Cancer Action, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, the NAACP, the Institute for International Education, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish Family and Children's Services, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco ballet, and the San Francisco symphony. Many of these organizations have honored him with awards.", "Not surprisingly from such a community-minded individual, Jim Hormel has throughout his life also harbored a firm commitment to public service. The first example of this was his service in the U.S. Coast Guard, Active Reserve, from 1951 to 1957. Later, he established the James C. Hormel Public Service Program at the University of Chicago Law School to encourage law students to go into public service. As a consequence of his leadership in this area, he was recognized by his peers when he received the Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago Alumni Association.", "His commitment to public service and his dedication to the cause of human rights ultimately came together when he was named as a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995. There, he helped the United States team press its case for improved human rights in nations as diverse as Cuba, China, and Iraq.", "Finally, he was nominated in 1997 to serve as an alternate representative of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly. Now, this part of his biography is particularly ironic, in light of the situation we find ourselves in today, because this position is subject to Senate confirmation, and, indeed, on May 23, 1997, this same U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Jim Hormel to represent this country at the United Nations.", "So we have a well-qualified nominee for Ambassador. He has had a remarkable and distinguished career in several fields. He has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service. In recent years he has gained firsthand experience in diplomacy as a representative of the United States. He was overwhelmingly approved by the Foreign Relations Committee, and most notably, he was confirmed by this very same U.S. Senate only 10 months ago.", "I suspect most listeners--and most of my colleagues--would expect such a nomination to be quickly brought to a vote and confirmed. Yet, the majority leader has refused to call this nomination for an up-or-down vote, and a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle have placed ``holds'' on the nomination.", "It seems clear to many of us why these Senators do not want to allow a vote on Jim Hormel's nomination: because Jim Hormel is gay. In a clear, unquestionable case of discrimination, these Senators refuse to let the full Senate vote for a qualified nominee because of his sexual orientation. This Senator does not believe that the Senate wants to be party to this kind of discrimination.", "Jim Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be encouraged to engage in public service. He is intelligent, civic minded, generous, and he is a person of proven accomplishment who wants to serve our country. So we need people like this in public service, and we cannot afford to drive them away because of their sexual orientation.", "I think that is the point that was made well in a letter from the former Secretary of State, George Shultz, and Mrs. Shultz, when they wrote to the majority leader urging Jim Hormel's speedy approval, stating that they know him very well, and concluding with this:", "We recommend him to you because we believe he would be a wonderful representative for our country. We hope that his nomination can be brought to the floor of the Senate for a vote as soon as possible.", "I submit to you, Mr. President, that George Shultz, former Secretary of State, should know who would be a wonderful representative and who would not be a wonderful representative of our country.", "So, as a matter of simple fairness, a qualified nominee with broad support, approved by the committee of jurisdiction, should at least be allowed a vote. If people have concerns, express them. Let's address them. But let's give the nominee a vote.", "In this regard, I want to compliment the distinguished chairman, my chairman, of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his thoughtful remarks on this subject when he appeared on NBC's Meet the Press on November 30, 1997. He said:", "I get tired of that stuff. We ought to vote on him. And I personally believe he would pass, and he'd become the next ambassador to Luxembourg. I just don't believe in prejudice against any individual, regardless. And frankly, we have far too much of that.", "I believe Senator Hatch is right on every point.", "So I call on the majority leader, Mr. President, to schedule a vote on Jim Hormel's nomination. I call upon those who have holds to allow the nomination to reach the floor. If they wish, let's debate the qualifications. Let's debate any allegation about him, or against him. But it is wrong to simply prevent the Senate from speaking on this nomination.", "I have seen news reports where some of the Senators who have ``holds'' on this nomination claim it is not because he is gay. They claim it is because of his views on certain issues involving gay rights, or something to that effect. The truth is I am not sure exactly what their objections are because they have been very reluctant to describe them publicly. I would certainly welcome the opportunity to meet privately with those Senators who are holding up the nomination to talk through their concerns.", "Perhaps my colleagues who have holds are embarrassed in some way, or perhaps they feel their arguments are not strong enough to stand the light of day. I am hard pressed to come to any other conclusion because, apart from fleeting quotes in news articles and vague statements by spokespersons, the Senators opposed to Jim Hormel have done little to lay out their case against him. They are content to just quietly allow the Senate rules to prevent a vote.", "That is not right, Mr. President. Around here, if a Senator takes a strong position on an issue, or a nomination, they have an obligation to their constituents, their colleagues, and the Senate itself, to explain themselves publicly. This is what the tradition of deliberative debate is all about.", "So I challenge my colleagues who have ``holds'' on this nomination to come to this very floor, explain why they believe Jim Hormel is unfit to become an American Ambassador because he happens to be gay. Let other Senators and the American people judge on the merits of the argument.", "From what I have read in news reports, I can anticipate that some of these Senators, if they choose to speak at all, will try to argue that this is not about Jim Hormel being gay--rather it is about his views on gay rights.", "We may hear a lot of stories about books that appear in the San Francisco Public Library to which Jim Hormel generously donated half a million dollars. Are we to understand that donating funds to a library means you are responsible for every book in this library? Many of these same books are in the Library of Congress. Is the Senate responsible, because we fund that library, for the content of every book in that library? Of course not, Mr. President. You know that. I know that. This is a specious argument. This is designed to kill a nomination.", "We may also hear stories about Jim Hormel's charitable giving, some of which has gone to organizations which support equal rights for gays and lesbians. Is equal rights a cause we in the Senate do not support? And even if this issue is subject to some controversy in the Senate, do the Senators blocking this nomination know or care that Jim Hormel has, in writing, committed to limiting his charitable contributions to noncontroversial areas such as the performing arts, museums, educational institutions, humanitarian assistance and health care? He will not use his office to advocate or promote any personal view on any issue and will not engage or associate himself with any outside activities that conflict with his official duties and responsibilities. We have that in writing. This is the only time I know of any ambassadorial nominee who has actually put that in writing. I find it, in a way, very difficult to recognize that he has to do it. Nonetheless he has done it.", "So the issue is a very simple one. We have a qualified nominee who was resoundingly approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. He is entitled to a vote, and I, as a U.S. Senator, am entitled to cast my vote for him.", "Mr. President, I yield the floor."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/03/10/S1680_the-nomination-of-james-c-hormel/"}
