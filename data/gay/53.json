Founded in 1982, Cream City Foundation serves as the leading foundation to mobilize philanthropic resources, build allied coalitions, effect positive change, and advance the dignity, worth, and health of every LGBT person in Southeastern Wisconsin.', u"This vision is realized through the organization's mission of building a strong foundation and infrastructure in the Southeastern Wisconsin LGBT community by distributing funds to emerging groups and programs that enhance the quality of life for LGBT people.", u"On the evening of September 22, the community will gather at the beautiful Milwaukee City Hall to note the incredible work of this vibrant foundation. The programs and interests that make up the work of Cream City Foundation are driven by a belief that philanthropy has an immense influence on creating long-lasting social change in our communities. Leadership from the LGBT community and our allies has been essential in bringing about that social change. We've come a long way, but our work is far from over. Despite all of our accomplishments over the years, homophobia is still all too pervasive.", u'Yet, with the continued help of Cream City Foundation, and the partnership of so many groups and individuals working in the community, there is no limit to what can be achieved in the years to come. These are historic times for the LGBT community. As we work together to build a community of acceptance and inclusion, Cream City Foundation will continue to lead the way.', u"It is fitting and appropriate that in the same year as the State of Wisconsin celebrates the 25th anniversary of the Nation's first Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights Act we take time to congratulate Cream City Foundation on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. Your efforts are truly changing the world. I'm delighted to join with all of Wisconsin's citizens in saluting Cream City Foundation."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/09/20/E1938_honoring-cream-city-foundation/'}
