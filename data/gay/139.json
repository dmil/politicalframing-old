Both Matt and Bruce are devoted community activists whose volunteerism and generous spirits have enriched the Monterey Bay region through their work in education, social justice, politics, the environment, health and the arts. Matt and Bruce are soon leaving the Monterey Peninsula and moving to Oregon.", "Bruce Horace Carlson was born on April 13, 1942 in Pittsburg, California. Bruce moved to the Monterey Peninsula in 1986 and as long as I have had the pleasure of knowing him, he has been a tireless advocate for Democratic politics and civil rights. In 1999 he became a founding board member of the Monterey County Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). He was a founding member of the Monterey County Coalition for Fairness and was a founding board member of the Monterey County Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Task Force. He was the co-director of Monterey's first Gay Pride Parade in 1992 and has been involved in several annual Pride Days since then. To say Bruce has been active in local and national Democratic politics would not go nearly far enough in describing the level of his contributions. Bruce has played a signifIcant role in the 27th Assembly District since 1996 holding various offices and committee seats. He has been a Representative for the Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee in Monterey County since 1994 and has been a board member of that body since 1996. In addition to his many hours of organizing and volunteering locally, Bruce has been a delegate to the California State Convention as well as being a delegate to the Democratic National Convention held in Los Angeles in 2000.", "Mr. Matt Friday was born on September 21, 1950 in Ottumwa, Iowa but has made his home on the Monterey Peninsula for over three decades. In those three decades, Matt has made an enormous and everlasting impact on this community in areas as diverse as education, the environment, health. the arts, as well as social justice and politics. I cannot think of any other individual in my district who has donated more time to these issues than Matt. Matt has tirelessly dedicated his efforts to the Monterey Bay community as a volunteer teacher, a co-founder of several environmental projects, a board member for the Monterey County AIDS Project (MCAP) and a frequent contributor to numerous local publications. Matt is also a respected and accomplished organizer in the area of human rights and has organized dozens of educational community forums on issues such as hate crimes, racism, and the PATRIOT Act.", "In the area of politics, Matt will leave behind a legacy of thoughtful, energetic and strategic volunteering, planning and organizing from which this community continues to benefIt. Matt Friday's name is synonymous with progressive politics on the Peninsula; to say he embodies politics does not overstate the level of his political activism in my district. It would be a futile effort to attempt to list all of Matt's contributions to local politics but some of his most notable achievements have been to co-organize a very successful precinct captains program with neighboring Santa Cruz County during the 2004 election, serving as Chair of the 27th Assembly District from 1999-2003, appointed to be a member of the California State Democratic Central Committee since 1996, serving as co-President of the Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee 2003-2004, and acting as an observer and commentator for KlON-TV during the 2000 Los Angeles Democratic National Convention.", "It is evident that Matt and Bruce will be missed for all of their contributions and volunteerism to the community, but Mr. Speaker I must also say that I will profoundly miss Matt and Bruce for their kind, warm, and generous spirits. I have spent many evenings in their wonderful home in Del Ray Oaks talking politics and human rights and admiring their gorgeous terraced garden which they lovingly cultivated over the years. I have always felt as if Matt and Bruce were a part of my extended family in my district. I will miss them both personally and professionally.", "Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity on the floor of this great House to thank Matt Friday and Bruce Carlson for their generosity of spirit and for the everlasting contributions they have made to the Monterey Peninsula. I wish them all the best as they embark on a new chapter in their lives."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/04/26/E762-2_in-honor-of-bruce-horace-carlson-and-matt-friday/"}
