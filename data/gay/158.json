Mr. Speaker, we have spent over a year working in a very concentrated way on trying to garner the resources and redirect them to communities that are highly at risk but have not had the resources follow the crisis.', u'Under my leadership as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus last year, we organized an initiative where we were able to identify tremendous resources to begin to do what needed to be done. We discovered a number of things, Mr. Speaker. We discovered that the resources of government were not following the AIDS crisis because the face of the new AIDS had not been unveiled sufficiently in this Nation. Most people still think of AIDS as a white gay disease. It is not. It is not a white gay disease. If there is anything that I can share with you today, it is that the gay community has done a wonderful job in, number one, doing outreach, education and prevention and getting people involved in the new therapies that are causing them to have a better quality of life and being able to go back into the workplace. We need to follow that example. It certainly can be done.', u'What do we find when we look at the African-American community? We find, of course, that it is the leading cause of death for African Americans between the ages of 25 and 44. What do we find when we look at African-American women? We find that in the new AIDS cases, we are 30 percent of that population. We also find that we are infected 16 times more than white women. And so we see this increase, we see this crisis, we see this emergency, and we are trying to get everyone to understand that it is indeed an emergency, it is indeed an emergency that we can do something about. And we need to continue to get the dollars to flow into outreach and education and research and therapy, all of those things that will help our community to do what can be done to stop the escalation of HIV and AIDS infection.', u'And so we got the $156 million and the RFPs went out and the responses came back and now we have community groups accessing dollars to do the kind of work that they so desperately have wanted to do that we have not given them the support for. They are saying to us, we have got to build and expand capacity, we have got to get more providers, we have got to make sure that we are doing the kind of creative outreach and education to get with that young population out there who we still have not been able to infiltrate. And so they are beginning to see that they can do these things and they can do them better.', u'Let us not stop now. Let us take the initiative that has been put together by the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) and others who are leading us in the Congressional Black Caucus to keep the resources moving. Let us take this opportunity to be on top of and in front of this funding so that we do not find ourselves having gotten $156 million, having the proposals responded to and people beginning to do the work and all of a sudden cut off because more money is not following. I think we can do that.', u'I am here today to add my voice to the efforts of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs. Christensen) and others who are working so hard to garner these resources.', u'Let me just say that the gentlewoman from Oakland, CA (Ms. Lee) got her county to declare the emergency that exists there. My county in Los Angeles was slow but they finally did it. They finally looked at the data, the statistics, and they finally understood that they should have done this a long time ago, that in Los Angeles County we have not done what could have been done. And so we have got a lot to straighten out in Los Angeles County. We have got to redo the entire process. We have got to make sure that our organization with its task forces and its RFP responsibilities, all of that, are done in such a way that the resources will get to where they must go.', u'Mr. Speaker, we will be back to talk a lot more about what must be done.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/09/30/H9180-4_combatting-hivaids-in-the-black-community/'}
