His name is Thomas Tracy.', u'I put this little tribute to him in the Extensions of Remarks a month ago, but for some reason I felt that it was important enough for me to rise today and say it to the whole Nation through the wonders of C-SPAN, that million-plus audience of ours, and through you, Mr. Speaker, to the world.', u'And then I want to discuss the terrible tragedy of AIDS and how it is growing exponentially and almost unnoticed in our society. First to Mr. Thomas Tracy.', u' TRIBUTE TO THOMAS TRACY: DISTINGUISHED IRISH-AMERICAN LEADER', u"I just want to recognize, Mr. Speaker, Tom's honorable achievements for the Irish-American community. He gives to umpteen charities as most good businessmen do. But Tom recently was recognized for his service. He received the 1996 Distinguished Leadership Award by the American Ireland Fund in the beautiful city of St. Francis by the Bay and I was just heartbroken that our unrelenting pace around here, this all-important budget fight that we are engaged in, kept me from flying up with my Sally and some of our older children up there to San Francisco to add our congratulations to Tom's tribute.", u"Here is what this award acknowledges, Mr. Speaker. That an American of Irish heritage, to quote partly from the award, whose lifetime accomplishments personify the spirit of the Irish immigrants who contributed to making our Nation the greatest in the history of mankind. If you take the troubled North and the Republic of Ireland and combine them, you are still not going to get to 5 million people. Far short of it. But in the United States of America, right through a primary grandparent, at least 25 percent of blood, is over 45 million Americans. On St. Patrick's Day, we know it reaches all 265 million. But some people say that that is a low figure, that it is realistically closer to 60 million out of the 260-plus million Americans.", u"I am especially proud of Tom because I am one of these rare Irishmen whose all 4 grandparents, came directly from Ireland, it is just becoming more rare, and I do not get too puffed up about it because I remember a cute story that John F. Kennedy looked at his own beautiful children, young John and his beautiful older sister Caroline and he said, ``It's too bad that they're not 100 percent Irish like me.''", u"And Jackie is supposed to have said to him, ``Oh, you mean they're mixed breed'' or something? And he never ever said that again.", u"My own five are half Danish and since my wife says she is Heinz 57, there is an extended Dornan family with, and I do not think I told you this, an 11th grandchild is on the way--my colleague from Florida did not know that--that there is none in that great gang of 11, and they all know about their Irish heritage, that is Irish on both sides. My mother's name was Mickey McFadden and her mother was Katie McDonough and my dad's mom was Mary Highland. It goes back to O'Donnells and just keeps on going.", u'So as a 100-percent Irishman, and I say that humbly, I am especially proud of Tom. I value my ancestry, because it has given me a feeling of being connected to a long history of people in love with life. The French have coined this beautiful phrase, Mr. Speaker, joie de vivre, the joy of life, and I have seen it in France from north to south, east to west but never have I seen it in any greater depth than in Ireland itself.', u"The Irish have suffered mightily through history. That is why their hearts have gone out to African Americans. It was probably one of the main motivating factors in my registering voters in a dangerous period of our country in the beautiful State of Mississippi and marching as I did with Martin Luther King on August 28, 1963 proudly in my Air Force captain's uniform, was all I had to offer.", u'But I identified as an Irishman with an 800-year turbulent history with the multicentury history of the suffering of those of African heritage in this Nation.', u'The essence of life is to persevere and conquer the challenges that God presents to us in life. An Irish Americans, like Thomas Tracy of southern California, they have excelled at that task. Tom has been associated with about 28 different issue-related organizations, including many devoted to achieving peace in Northern Ireland. Over the last 5 years Tom has spent much time and just so much generosity with his own financial resources trying to work toward that peace. Just so many trips to Northern Ireland and to Dublin that I lost track of them. Over just the last 5 years he has just donated himself with great energy toward that goal of peace in that troubled beautiful little Emerald Isle.', u"I share one of Mr. Tracy's other passions, our love for our Christian faith, our Catholic faith. We have both been dedicated to strengthening and protecting the church, and in particular our own diocese. Mr. Tracy has been deeply involved in the diocese of Orange, CA, where he served at key committees, numerous Catholic organizations to help people of every level in society, and he has been the leader in the effort to gain sainthood for Father Junipero Serra, who has already reached the first plateau of being referred to as Blessed Father Serra. His statue is one of the two statues representing the State of California in this beautiful rotunda area, the other being the great freedom fighting Reverend King, Protestant Minister, during the period in California leading up to the Civil War.", u'I thank Tom Tracy for his many contributions. He honors all of us who are Irish Americans for his dedication, his good will, and his brave heart.', u"Now, if I was going to put a title on that, I would ask our recorders to make it ``Tribute to a Great Irish American, Thomas Tracy.''", u'Then I would draw a line through the Congressional Record and start on a not so happy note.', u'Mr. Speaker, do you remember the legionnaires disease? Remember the American Legion was having a convention in the City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, and some got sick at the convention, and a few who were older went into respiratory failure, could not be saved, some died after they got home, and it began to hit the evening news coast to coast, night after night after night? It was a terrible tragedy.', u'You say legionnaires disease and doctors still come to attention and think about that frightening period. Part of it was frightening because it involved infectious spores getting into the air-conditioning system, and I would not even mention the hotel if I thought of it, because they probably had to rename it and refurbish the hotel. But here is my point. The death toll, the total death toll, Mr. Speaker, was 34 human beings. Thirty-four souls on their way to god earlier than their families had planned. Thirty-four.', u'I just got back from the Center for Disease Control, doing research for a point of personal privilege to answer our colleague, Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, on the charges, the horrible charges that he made against me on the House floor on May 14, and I will do it in the middle of the day. I am sorry to interrupt legislative business, but on Wednesday or Thursday of next week I will do it. If Thursday is a get-away Thursday, I will ask, demand, as is my right, I will ask the leadership, to coordinate with the leadership, because I do not have to ask their permission to do it, it is a right, a wonderful treasured right in this House, I will ask for the time on Tuesday or Wednesday.', u"But I have been doing research on AIDS, along with researching the circumstances surrounding that wild abuse of Federal buildings, so-called Jubilee Party that took place on Thomas Jefferson's birthday in April, April 13, and here is what my current research on AIDS is causing me to believe: That a homosexual lobby, does not want us to discuss the enormity of this death toll. They do not want anybody, frankly, to discuss this greater health problem in the history of our Nation unless they are the ones doing the discussing. They want to define all the parameters of the discussion so as never to put a tough edge on it, that this is basically a medical nightmare driven by behavior and conduct.", u"Keeping in mind that 34 death toll figure of legionnaires disease, and I do not have the time to go back to 1981, which by the way was Mr. Gunderson's first year, Ronald Reagan's first year, it has been an amazing 16 years, but the cumulative figure as of the end of this month for deaths in this country is 360,000.", u'Now, anybody listening on C-SPAN, if they want to go get a pencil, I would tell them, Mr. Speaker, to go do it. But if they are too lazy to get up out of the chair and get a pad and pencil, this one is easy. Just think of a circle; 360 degrees. Three hundred sixty. That is how many have died, 360,000.', u"And it is probably a little low because in 1981 and 1982 and 1983 and 1984, the then Surgeon General, Dr. Everett Koop, told me that they were not counting many AIDS deaths that out of understandable and totally understandable empathy for families, rather than say that their young man or any family member had died of a fatal venereal disease, AIDS, they would say only on the death report the proximate cause; lung failure, dementia, Kaposi's sarcoma. They would just write down deceased of cancer.", u"And then all doctors, all doctors worthy of the name, decided that it did no good to fight this major public health problem, to hide the true cause, the breakdown of the immune system that brought about the pulmonary problems, the heart problems, the stroke, the cancer, the dementia, and we started keeping accurate figures by the middle of the 1980's. So according to Dr. Koop, about 20,000, maybe double that, were lost. I will say 20. Add it to the 320,000 dead as of New Year's Eve last year, 1995, that would be 340. And then this year, I am low, I am saying 20,000 dead by the end of this month, and that brings us to 360, when the truth is I am probably 5 or 10,000 low, but 360,000. A third of a million is a good figure to try to memorize so you can discuss this intelligently with people. So, 34 legionnaires disease, 360,000 for AIDS.", u'Now, here are the figures just for the last 3 years. Dead in 1993, now there are lots, thousands of drug users in here, thousands of people that do both homosexual activity and drug use, and hemophiliacs are in here, a very small figure, an infinitesimal cause of infection unknown, the overwhelming figure, somewhere always between 65 and 75 percent is homosexual activity, basically sodomy of some kind.', u'1993: 42,992. Death toll per week, I just divided it by 52 a minute ago, 827 per week. What a horrible death toll. Not 34 in the entire course of legionnaires disease, but 827 a week.', u'1994: 46,050. That is 886 a week. And last year, the year when I enjoyed myself so much traveling around this country debating with good men like Senator Bob Dole reaching for that secular holy grail of the Presidency, 1995, wonderful year for me and my family, a tough year, but while that year, those 12 months were slipping by, 48,979 people died of AIDS.', u'And children in here. It is horrendous. We have lost 4,000 children to AIDS over the years. Now, the homosexual lobby hates it when you call the children innocent victims because they all want to say they are innocent victims. But the children not one of them got it from behavior they got it from childbirth or from hemophilia or from the bad blood transfusion or some blood byproduct. Some 4,000 innocent little children over the course of this nightmare.', u'Now, I just now added up those 3 years. That is 138,021 out of the last 15 years. Out of the 360,000, in round numbers, almost half just in the last 3 years.', u'What is the half year figure going to be at the end of this month? I said 20. Well, if I look at 1995, it is going to be closer to 25,000. Where are we going?', u'I do not know if I will have time in my point of personal privilege to put these figures into the Record, so I am going to do it now for the wars of our Nation to give a balance of how large that figure of 360,000 dead people are.', u'Here are the figures, and then I will be able to refer to them in my point of personal privilege. I would hope that every youngster who has ever studied American history would memorize the Revolutionary War as I have and that will teach them something about their Congress.', u'Take the number of this House, 435 men and women, and add 4,000. That is how many died under George Washington, the Father of our Country, in the Revolutionary War; 4,435. Well, at the rate people are dying of AIDS, in 4.5 weeks, 5 weeks, we averaged a whole 6.5 years, from Concord Bridge April 19 of 1975, hardly a man is now alive, all the way up to Yorktown, October 19, a precise 6.5 years, 4,435. But not in 6.5 years, in less than 5 or 6 weeks we equaling that now in AIDS deaths.', u'I will go more quickly here but I hope somebody is writing it down. It took me a lot of time to research the this. The war of 1812: 22,060. I have that memorized since I was a little kid. I do not know why. And the Mexican War, 1,733--1,733 for manifest destiny, reaching out toward the heights of Chapultepec in Mexico.', u'The Civil War, the War Between the States, or for my southern friends here the war of northern aggression. I do not want to politicize this. They are all Americans, we know that. We do not know how many young southern lads died from other causes, like disease or Northern prison camps. We have a Northern figure on that, so that is a mystery forever, but in the North 224,097 died of the diseases associated with men coming together who had never lived in an urban environment and catching diseases that they had no immune system operating for, the thousands that died at Andersonville, 10,000 there alone, it is 224,097.', u'But set aside those extra deaths. In the Mexican War 11,500 died outside of battle combat. I want to talk battle deaths. Billy Yank, the blue of the North. Battle deaths. Gettysburg, Antietam, Stone Mountain, Murfreesboro, TN, all of it, Shiloh, 140,414. Johnny Reb fought Billy Yank with a great ferocity, because the death toll in battle is much lower. Under Robert E. Lee and the rest of the southern generals it is only 74,524.', u'Now, you do not have to add those together, people that are taking this down, I will do it for you: 214,938. Fair to round that off at 215,000. There it is, Mr. Speaker, 215,000 combat deaths. That is only adding 62--215,000 combat deaths.', u'Let me come back to my AIDS figure: 360,000. It is 145,000 more than we lost in the Civil War, and nobody talks about it here, because the homosexual lobby does not want us to talk about these horrible figures.', u"They just want money. I will give them more than they are asking for. Because it is a tragedy beyond cancer, heart disease, or stroke or the things that begin to bedevil us in our 60's and 70's and 80's. These are young people, mostly males, taken out in the prime of life when they should be returning God's creative gift of life and contributing most to this society, to this society.", u"The Spanish-American War, this is getting down toward Legionnaire's disease size, not quite, 385,000--excuse me, 385--385 people, less than 400 died in combat in the Spanish-American War, including a few people under Teddy Roosevelt, running up San Juan Hill because the Rough Riders horses had not arrived at Cuba in time. On Kettle Hill, now called the charge up San Juan Hill, just a few dozen men, taking Manila Bay in the Phillipine Islands, not a single man lost. Dewey said, ``Fire when ready, Gridley,'' and killed hundreds of Spanish on their ships, not a single American sailor lost. Disease in that war, even that is not too horrible, given the change of climate for a lot of American soldiers, 2,061. But back to the combat deaths, 385.", u"Now we get into some serious killing in the name of making the world safe for democracy, my father's war, where he was on a train that was derailed by German fire and rolled down a hill with a hot stove that they had purloined from a little French railroad station, rolling around with all the hot coals burning men and the stove itself killing men. My dad got up, stood up, thought every bone in his body was broken, covered in blood and realized it was the blood of other men. My dad was poison gassed twice, shrapnel, small wound in his face. And in that war, 53,513. It was ferocious combat, mostly in the last 6 months, after we declared war, April 6, 1917. There was a long, slow period in the beginning there, and Black Jack Pershing refused to have French officers over our men so it took us a long time, till basically the spring. And then serious fighting in the summer of 1918, all over at the 11th hour, the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. Combat deaths, most of them loaded toward the end, 53,513, very close, by the way, to Vietnam, although not over 10 years, all in six months, 53,513, AIDS 360,000 plus.", u"Now let us go to World War II. I am sure that anybody who even has a clue of how many people were killed in battle from the Aleutian Islands to the North African deserts, under the sea, on the sea and every battle from Santa Cruz to Guadalcanal, all the way up to Okinawa and the invasions before that from Tarawa to Iwo Jima and then of the fighting cross Europe, General MacArthur's island hopping campaign, death from Bataan and Corregidor right down to the prisoners who died after the cessation of hostilities in mid-August of 1945. What was the combat death toll of World War II? It was 292,131. So AIDS has already killed 68, 70, 75,000 more than all the battle deaths on every continent of the world, even bombing in Australia in 1942, Japanese bombing. It has now eclipsed World War II.", u"Korea, 3 years of fighting, in 3 years and one month, compared to Vietnam's almost 10 years, 33,651 in Korea, one-tenth of the death toll of AIDS.", u'In Vietnam, a figure that changes tragically every quarter, every half a year by the finding of some remains or the solving of some mystery, Vietnam, hard figure to memorize because I had memorized it recently as 47,366 because that was the great fighter wing at Da Nang, the gunfighters, I see 3 more is added, 47,369. Compare that 10-year struggle that tore our Nation apart. There is another almost 11,000 there of people who died in plane crashes, all the poor flying safety situations that are always involved with a combat area, but Vietnam has torn this country apart. And given the course of the Clinton administration, it is still tearing our country apart. We are still lying through the bureaucracy to the American MIA wives who come to town with the aging mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters who are now double the age of their siblings that are still missing in action with the built-in bias, pro-Hanoi bias of this administration because of its leadership at the top. We are still suffering Vietnam.', u'But the death toll, including the missing in action, 47,369. All the names on the wall, including those 11,000 automobile and plane crash accidents during the course of that decade, it is 58,000 names on the wall, 58,000, add 302,000 and you have got the AIDS deaths.', u'What are we doing about this AIDS death toll? We have thrown $35 billion into research, Mr. Speaker. It has already cost our Nation $107 billion. Because I am going to deliberately restrain my innate passion during my point of personal privilege in the middle of next week so that people focus on my words and not on my delivery style or anything, I will not constrain my passion tonight. Let me tell you what is causing this unbelievable health nightmare, Mr. Speaker.', u'Homosexual activists refuse to apologize for or give up the wild, promiscuous lifestyle that is the main driving, evil engine of this public health catastrophe of 360,000 dead people. Here is what I learned in one of my many trips around the world to educate myself on this issue.', u'I have studied this trip in Bangkok, this nightmare trip of AIDS contamination worldwide, AIDS infection. I have asked about it in Arab countries where the figure is very low and they are loath to speak about it. I have asked about it in Beijing, where they said it, contemptuously, that is was a Western decadence problem, and they never would have a problem in China, and, oh, do they have a problem building now. Fascinating front page section story in the Washington Post, New York Times, I think, just a few weeks ago about how China is a nightmare ready to explode, way beyond our third of a million death toll.', u'Here is what I learned last week up at NIH. I have been up there several times. I have been to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. I do not know that Mr. Gunderson has ever been up to Bethesda. I know he has not been to the World Health Organization in Geneva. I took my wife there. She was stunned when they told her 55, 60, 70 million worldwide would die before--no, 100 million or more would die before the thing even peaked.', u'My wife turned to me and said, how many died in World War II? I said 55 million. She turns back to Dr. James Chin and Dr. Jonathan Mann and said, you are wiping out 100 million and that is almost double World War II? I have researched this all over the world.', u"My last trip last week up to NIH tells me this? I said to a man I greatly admire, Dr. Tony Fauci, I cannot, God could not design a better research doctor and dedicated person to fight this problem. He was at the table in the cafeteria at NIH in Bethesda when he and Dr. Bob Gallo looked at one another and decided they had a fatal virus among homosexual males in LA and New York. They called it GRID, gay related immunodeficiency. I do not know why they would use that adjective ``gay.'' There is nothing happy about 360,000 people dead. There is no gaiety here, no cheerfulness, mirthfulness. It is the saddest thing I have ever encountered healthwise or anybody has encountered in the history of our Nation.", u'Tony Fauci, as you may recall, Mr. Speaker, came up during the debates of 1988 between George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis, Vice President Bush. And Bush was lucky enough to go second.', u"I was sitting next to the future Secretary of Commerce Bob Mosbacher and his wife Georgette and the--who was the narrator then? Was it Bernie Shaw? Was it a panel? Was it Tom Brokaw? I think it was Tom Brokaw. He asked Governor Dukakis, who are your heroes? There was this long, painful pause. I remember I turned to Bob Mosbacher and I said, ``He is thinking right now, other than myself, Michael Dukakis.'' That is how long the pause was.", u"Finally he said, ``Dr. Jonas Salk.'' That was a quarter of a century ago, over polio. I thought, come on, Mr. Vice President, respond with Tony Fauci. It was like mental telepathy. I hope he says Tony Fauci. And there was no one else for a follow-up by Dukakis, just Jonas Salk.", u"So it comes to George Bush and he had the advantage. He had time to think about it. He said, there is a doctor, and he could not think of his first name, and he said, Dr. Fauci at NIH. And Mosbacher says to me, nice job of mental telepathy. I said more, more. Then he hit the ball out of the park. Probably won the election. This was his defining moment in 1988. He says, ``And any cop on the beat anywhere in America.'' That did it for George Bush.", u'But that is how far back Tony Fauci goes in my mind. That is 8 years ago this coming October. Fauci is great. So at the end of this tremendous tour, where he introduced me to some wonderful HIV-infected people that are fighting for their lives in a program, I hope they have changed their conduct. I hope they tell other people not to engage in the high risk politics, in the high risk political and homosexual movements and the high risk sexual activity that is shortening their lives.', u"After it was all over, I walked through the tremendous labs and I met people from Palermo, Sicily, a young lady doctor working with Tony Fauci. I met people from northern Italy, from Bologna, from France, from all over the world. What a team they put together. And, Mr. Speaker, none of them have the money anywhere in Europe, let alone the rest of the world. It is not up to European or American medical standards. Nobody has the money that they have at NIH and the Centers for Disease Control that we in this Congress without any hesitation have given of the taxpayers' money that we are supposed to guard to try and find some kind of a--there never will be a cure, Dr. Fauci tells me, you cannot get an infinitesimal retrovirus out of the T cell that it has worked its way into. That is impossible. It keeps replicating as they attack it anyway.", u'What we need is a vaccine to hold off the onslaught, to build up the immune system, to prevent the infection or, once they have it, to keep the T cell count up and extend the life into another decade beyond the decade or so that some stronger people have been able to fend off the onslaught of full AIDS.', u"We are out in the hall and we are about to leave. I said to Dr. Fauci, I said, ``Tony, I am hearing some bad rumors. I am hearing that in the homosexual communities in the hot spots of America, Key West, Miami, New York, LA, San Francisco, that young homosexuals are doing two things--get this, Mr. Speaker--``they are playing Russian roulette with deliberate high risk unsafe sex because it adds to the erotic thrill to play roulette with the HIV virus.'' And he nods in affirmation. ``Yes,'' he says, ``that is happening.''", u'And I said, and then I hear that there is kind of a communal thing that when you get hit a with a positive test on the HI virus, it is almost like you joined a greater community. You get to see Whoopi Goldberg or Barbara Streisand wearing a red ribbon at the Academy Awards or you see these great tributes paid to theatrically talented people who died at the Tony Awards, the award system for Broadway plays, that it is somehow or other a shared experience to get the virus and be on a greased path to dying of AIDS. He said, yes, that is true.', u'Then there is a third thing--imagine this, Mr. Speaker--he says, there is a third thing beyond deliberately playing high risk Russian roulette and wanting to join a bigger community of sufferers. He says, a lot of them, paraphrasing Dr. Fauci very closely here, a lot of them have a sort of exhaustion, a mental exhaustion, a frustration over trying to beat the HIV virus, and they are just sort of giving up and saying it is going to get me eventually anyway.', u'You put those three things together, high risk erotic sex, telling yourself that lie, two, the shared community, that we are all in this together and, three, I cannot stand this ugly game of trying to avoid it so I am throwing caution to the wind. I am abandoning hope. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.', u'Wiliam F. Buckley once recommended that as a cruel joke, I assume as a tattoo on high-risk practitioners. So there it is. It is starting to go back up. I honestly thought when I got the figures on 1995 from the Centers for Disease Control about an hour and a half ago, I was sure it was going to go 43,000 in 1993, 46,000 in 1994, and drop back to 42,000 or lower last year, but it almost breaks 50,000. So I can--I can feel it coming for the end of this month. Around the middle of July I will call the center down at the six Centers for Disease Control that handles this, or I will call Sharon Katz, who does a great job trying to keep me informed on this up here in D.C. She is congressional liaison for--legislative liaison for CDC, and say, OK, because they are only going to a yearly report.', u'Can you believe that, Mr. Speaker? When this thing started, I could get a weekly report, a published monthly report. Every month I could find out--I will show you what it looked like. I would get this: Table 13, monthly cases diagnosed during the interval of 1 month, case fatality rate, deaths occur in the interval. Then they went to quarterly, and they stayed that way until about 2 years ago, and they went to semiannually. Now they tell me no more semiannual report on June 30, you got to get a report once a year. Why? The reports are higher than ever. More people are dying than ever before, and now they are only going to tell us once a year.', u'So they told me informally we will give you round figures at the mid point of the calendar year on June 30, and if it breaks 50,000, then this has not peaked yet in spite of killing off 360,000 people, of which certainly 300,000 were hard partiers.', u'Drugs, which is one of the unknown stories of how this is transmitted so frequently in the homosexual--among the homosexual hard parties; the drug use among circuit-riding homosexual parties is almost as bad as it is at the lowest level of poverty in our big cities where drugs is a release from the depression of not being a player in the American dream. These are people that are just looking for hedonistic pleasure and an end in and of itself.', u'Now, Mr. Speaker, I give you a preview on my point of personal privilege. Here is my second draft. It is over 30 pages long. I can get through it in an hour. I am not a bad extemporaneous speaker, as speakers go around this place, but I am going to read this one on Wednesday or Thursday because I will not be accused of not having love for my fellow man.', u"I watched yet another stupid Phil Donahue show this morning where he had two young reverends on, one from somewhere in Colorado, one from Nashville, TN, and I guess it was a rerun from sometime around November where they had a play on Halloween that they called Hell House where they tried to show young people that the wages of sin is death, and why they got through the whole hour, because he put them against a lesbian Presbyterian minister and somebody from Planned Parenthood, of course, picking out somebody as beautiful as young Liz Taylor to, you know, use all the softened euphemistic words for killing babies in their mothers' wombs, and Donahue left objectivity when the first 10 minutes of the show was insulting these two handsome, in their mid to late 30's, these two Protestant ministers, and I was shocked, and so was my wife, that the ministers did not bring up that liberals approve of this when it is called scaring them straight in prison where you take young people to prisons who are flirting with crime, they are in their first arrest period, grand theft auto or something, or maybe caught carrying a gun, they have not used it yet, and they put them in a prison, and these big grizzly cons come in, rough talk to them, scaring them straight, or taking high school kids and showing them pictures, graphic, bloody, color pictures, of automobile accidents from prom night or any drinking night at a party and trying to get young people who think they are going to live forever to conceptualize in their head that there but for the grace of God would be me torn to shreds in a small Japanese-made car that is lying on the highway in three or four pieces with five or six dead teenagers or one who survives to be paralyzed all of his or her life. They say, my gosh, I am drinking at parties and driving. Why is it OK to show teenagers, and I am all for this graphic pictures of teens dying when they drink and drive, or what MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, does, to say this is what people do when the drunk crosses the line and because he is sotted out of his mind, usually is so limp he survives, but he front-ends a van full of children and kills 27 people on a bus, which happened in Kentucky or Tennessee a few years back. That young driver is still in prison, I assume, that killed, burned to death all those children. Or how many times did we read about the innocent family driving along at 45 miles per hour and some drunk comes across the divider on a two-lane road, no divider, just across a line, and crashes into their car killing them. Why is it valid to show them these pictures, but it was not valid for these reverends to show an abortion scene, an AIDS death, the young teenager in the casket and the family all crying. It was a fascinating show, but there was all the careful language, and here is what the lesbian minister kept saying:", u'My lesbianism, my homosexuality, my gayness, is a gift from God, a gift from God. How many times do I hear this? It is a gift, gift, gift, gift? Well, in the case of HIV and AIDS, it is the gift that does not stop giving, and what it gives in the end is a terrible, terrible death.', u"What a tragedy to think of 360,000 young people. The Presbyterian minister kept saying how people reject children. How rare must that be for a family to reject someone who is dying of AIDS when they come to their family. I think that must be a minority, I know, every family that I have ever heard of that lets that poor young person die inside the womb, the nurturing unit of the family. That has been my experience. That is what the priests and nuns and ministers that I talked to say. We maybe went through a rough period when people did not understand it, but the scene I have in my mind is a young person, usually a male, who contracted it in his early 20's, he is dying in his late 20's; that is the bubble in the middle of where most of these deaths are from 25 to 35, that is the largest category out of the 360,000, and he is there with his mother putting her cool hand on his fevered forehead, his father holding his hand, saying I still love you, son, picturing them all those times, the campouts, or the Little League, or the Pop Warner Football, and the reverend, a priest, a minister, a rabbi; they are giving the last rights, telling them Jesus loves you, God loves you, you are forgiven, your soul is white, you are going directly to heaven because you suffered so much on this Earth.", u'I do not see this grinding religious right, vengeful nastiness that people talk about.', u'A reporter, I know he is a nice fellow, he wrote a stupid article on the front page of this new competing paper with Roll Call called the Hill, and he said--he even singled me out and said the Republicans had to go along with voting for money for AIDS, they were embarrassed to do it. Who embarrassed us into it? And here is the line that he sort of apologized for. Point well taken, Congressman, he said. He writes in there, even Bob Dornan voted for the Ryan White money.', u'The vote I think was 430 to 3 or 4; yeah, 430-something to 3, and the three people who voted had a very good reason for voting no. All three are friends of mine, that there is no accounting for this money, that it is given to homosexual groups, and that they squander millions of dollars of it in propaganda efforts that are causing more people to become enamored with sodomy, and they are killing themselves with more anal sex, and our tax dollars is going toward that end.', u'But the overall cost of little Ryan White, a hemophiliac whose blood supply that he was using to keep his life extended was polluted deliberately by high-risk people in San Francisco and other places who knew they were contaminated with the AIDS virus, but they wanted to go in and get paid for a blood donation so they could go out and get drugs.', u"This is a proper name for the bill; maybe Ryan White, but how many times have I heard Phil Donahue twist this whole thing and was one of young Ryan's pallbearers, how often has the movement used the Ryan family to, they think, get money out of us that even I have to go along with it.", u'I willingly voted for that money, and I say it again, Mr. Speaker, more money until we can turn this thing around and get a vaccine because I tell you at the tail end of this, when AIDS hits, there is not much unsafe sex going on, there is not any smoking marijuana, there is not much drug abuse except the drugs like morphine to take the pain away. There is no partying time.', u"But I turned on PBS the night before last. Did you see, Mr. Speaker, the 3-hour special on Tiananmen Square? It was gripping. And going into it and coming out of it was an ad for something on Public Broadcasting next week about a show on Broadway, Angels Over Broadway; I do not know what the title is. It is written by a homosexual about--to put a glorifying spin with a tragic, tragicomic spin on this AIDS crisis, and they showed a scene from like a park bench of two young male homosexuals, and one is speaking to another, and he says, yes, the angel of death has come with his wine-colored kiss, and he holds out his arm, and there are Karposi's lesions, and he looks at his friend and says, yes, I am a legionnaire. Maybe you think of legionnaires' disease, only 35. I am a legionnaire.", u'It made me think of Dr. Tony Fauci a week ago saying, Bob, they are getting exhausted with fighting off the roulette of maybe getting it, so they give up and just end up contracting it and become a legionnaire.', u'Well, in my work around here over the last 16 years as this has built with the 2-year gap from gerrymandering where I was not here, in 1983 and 1984, and there was not a single speech, Mr. Speaker, in this Chamber or the U.S. Senate during those 2 years I was out, 1983 and 1984. Nobody really knew about it in 1982. It had only been discovered in the middle of 1981.', u'So when I came back, I called the Library of Congress. How many speeches on AIDS in this Chamber? Bill Dannemeyer was working on it, my colleague from California; Henry Waxman, another colleague from California, had jumped over 5 to 10 years of seniority and become chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, and I said how many speeches had been given?', u'Mr. Speaker, not a single Member ever came to this leadership lectern or those two lecterns in the well and had spoken about AIDS from its first reported beginnings all the way through 1985 until I took the well, and I have spoken on it over and over and over again, and I speak from the compassion of the heart that I think is pure and brave to stop the killing of one another of young Americans, and I am not getting much help from organized groups that will put on the disgusting display that went on at the historic Andrew W. Mellon auditorium.', u"If the hour had not caught up with me, I was invited to come by and take a tour of that facility. I have been in there, several tuxedo dinners when I first got here in the early--late 1970's early 1980's. I have not been by there awhile, but I drove by last night, and guess what, Mr. Speaker? What the homosexual jubilee party is there called Screw Alley along the side, its not an alley at all. If there is any alley, it would be behind the building, and that is blocked off with cyclone fences because the Ronald Reagan building is being built immediately behind it, and if there ever was an alley, it would be turned into a beautiful atrium walk area. The two sides of the building have exquisite carriage side entrances with modern, leveled-off places for disabled Americans in wheelchairs to get in.", u'The beautiful front, with six massive Doric columns, faces precisely on the architectural line from the center of the building, the Mellon Auditorium is on the opposite side or south side of the street, the National Museum of American History.', u"As I stood on the sidewalk and looked up at the Mellon and thought about this party on Thomas Jefferson's birthday, and thought about 2,000 writhing, half-naked bodies, and people going out into the darkness to have illicit sex and urinating on both sides of the building, and by the way, everything that I put in the Congressional Record, everything that I sent around in the Dear Colleague letter by Marc Morano, a young reporter I have known for years, because he did work for Rush Limbaugh, Morano was not alone. He had an associate with him. Some homosexual reporters from one of the city newspapers backed it up on the May 15 edition of the Washington Times.", u'These carriage entrances on the side are one of the three front entrances of this building, and there were no construction cones. They had six rent-a-cops, Mr. Speaker, six from a group called APACS, that was the lowball bidder, to control 2,000 people determined that night, inadvertently or by high-risk Russian roulette, to get themselves infected and join the greater community.', u"As I stood on the sidewalk and looked at one of my favorite museums, right up there with the National Museum of Art, the Aerospace Museum, and the Natural History Museum, I look across the street and something struck me. Inside the wall, on the side facing the Mellon Auditorium, is the Star-Spangled Banner, 20 or 30 times bigger than Old Glory behind you, Mr. Speaker; the actual flag from the night of September 13 and 14, 1814, when Francis Scott Key, prisoner on a British ship, looked at this massive flag by the dawn's early light, and composed on the deck of this British man-of-war our Star-Spangled Banner.", u'I may open my special order, not a special order, I will do one that night, too, for cleanup purposes, but by point of personal privilege, I may put that in the beginning, that across the street from the Mellon, on the very wall, I paced it off, 40 Dornan steps, pretty close to a yard, I guess, across Constitution Avenue, there is a big hemispheric pond to accommodate the circular driveway in front of the National Museum of American history. So I went up to the edge of the pond, detoured left, squared it off, and started counting again, and from the front of the Mellon to the wall, upon the inside of which is this massive, original Star-Spangled Banner, it is 106 paces, 106 paces from the front of the Star-Spangled Banner itself, blocked only by the thickness of the wall that it is on, and people are urinating on Constitution Avenue and acting like it is some Roman basshanal, all in the name of, brace yourself, Mr. Speaker, raising, according to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson], in this well, $50,000 for the Whitman-Walker Clinic.', u"I learned up at NIH, Mr. Speaker, that one of the selected few lucky people in the Government program using Interleukin IL-2, which seems to be successfully rebuilding their immune system, getting their count from below the 200 figure, where they are declared an AIDS victim, back up to 1,000 almost. And I asked what is mine, what is a normal healthy person's, and they said 600 to 800, probably more like 600. This seems to be working to extend lives, but they will always be infectious with AIDS until the day God calls them, but they can maybe have a dream of a normal life.", u'Do you know what it costs for one of these lucky patients in the Government program? One hundred thousand dollars a year. So at this jubilee, and by the way, I want to explain to you what jubilee is, they were more concentrating on the cherry, its third definition of virginity in that dictionary, that is their clever title. I am going to show the ads for this bacchanal in some of the homosexual newspapers. I will tell you what the word jubilee means; right now do you know what that word is? It is a Judaic, a Hebrew word. Every 50 years every prisoner would be freed, debtors would be relieved of their debts that they had not yet paid off. It is a 50-year religious celebration of piety and reverence toward God, kind of like a super Yom Kippur of 50-year, half a century point.', u'And in the Catholic Church, I had forgotten, it is a formal title for a 25-year religious celebration, the holy year of jubilee that the Pope in Rome will declare for a year of joy and prayer and thanks to God for any good that we have managed to treasure in our lives; jubilee, a religious or Christian ceremony. In African-American history it is a series of religious songs and hymns. African-Americans in the slave days would have their jubilee songs, singing about the day of freedom.', u"To take that word and apply it to cherry, with a sexual overtone, and then to have these pictures that I am going to bring to the floor, carefully censored for the tender eyes of the new crop of pages, I will show how this bacchanal was advertised. Mr. Speaker, one final thing on this tragedy that I have done more hard work on than most Members that I know around here, and I am sick and tired of getting my motives questioned and my integrity challenged with vile words like ``hater'' and ``bigot'' and ``prejudice.'' I went up to the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center.", u'When I got on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 8 years ago, I made up a list of all of the intelligence operations around this Nation and around the world that I would visit. Unfortunately, I put way at the bottom of the list, medical intelligence. I thought it was like the museum that I dearly enjoyed at Walter Reed, going back to the conquering of yellow fever and the building of the Panama Canal, which a young colonel named Walter Reed eventually lent his name to this largest of all Army hospitals in the world.', u'I have looked at some of the historical things at Bethesda, but I just had not gotten up to Fort Detrick, MD. Finally I went up there, because someone in the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence upstairs said they give a frightening briefing on the growth of AIDS around the world.', u"I think I told our Speaker pro tem, a fellow Air Force officer, I think I told him this in the Cloakroom, and if I did, forgive my advancing years here in retelling something, but the nation of Zimbabwe is no longer fit, I say to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Stearns] for U.N. peacekeeping or peacemaking duty. They infected so many people in the torn country of Somalia that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has said, ``You are not fit for U.N. service anywhere in the world any longer.''", u'Zimbabwe is about to be quickly followed by Uganda, by Kenya, the jewel of all the British-African possessions, where the late Bill Holden still has his beautiful camera safari at Treetops Lodge. Kenya is about to be blackballed for any future service, written off. Guess why? Zimbabwe two commanders ago, their General Shalikashvili died of AIDS. The last commander after him died of AIDS. The current commander is infected with HIV, as is 75 percent of his officer corps, 75 percent of his NCO corps, and 75 percent of his Air Force and line soldiers. That is three out of four. I did not say 7.5; 75 percent are infected with AIDS in Zimbabwe. Is this incredible? The whole army is going to die off soon.', u'I have a point here. When Uganda and Chad and Kenya and Rwanda and Burundi and Malawi and all of the rest of the countries in that terrible belt south of the Atlas Mountains and north of South Africa, but now it is starting to rip into South Africa, the evil of apartheid was a false break because of cruelly restricting the free flow of peoples, and it kept out AIDS for a while. Now is tearing apart South Africa.', u'Of course, Rhodesia is the other white enclave that held out. It changed its name to the ancient city of Zimbabwe when it achieved its independence. Get this, Mr. Speaker. If Zimbabwe cannot pull a duty in Bosnia, guess who is going to be asked to ante up more than our fair share? The United States of America, Great Britain, France; countries where, when somebody has HIV, they are no longer worldwide deployable, they are no longer combat trainable, they will never drive a tank, a truck, fly a plane, a helicopter, or sail on a ship or under the waters in a sub.', u'That is why I am trying to make our military 100-percent HIV-free, and lavish love and medical attention on the regiment size of 1,000 people that we have left, put them in the VA and make sure they get equally, if not better care, than they get right now on active duty when they admit, when they are honest, that they are not pulling their load or their fair share.', u"How can we go from 1,400,000 Americans on active duty all the way down to where we are now, and keep on active duty the people that are infected, while we are putting healthy men and women out of active duty? This nightmare of world AIDS' exponential growth is not being discussed in this Chamber or in the U.S. Senate, one, because it involves that potent little word, s-e-x, but mainly because the people that have a grip on what should be the truth about this epidemic, and how it is spread by heterosexual behavior and conduct, promiscuous conduct and lack of sanitation worldwide, and in this country, which is the most sanitary Nation in the world, without a question of Europe, driven mainly by homosexual conduct and behavior.", u'Mr. Speaker, I appreciated this time set the scene for my point of personal privilege, question of personal privilege on the floor, where I will defend my honor, defend my heart which I believe to be pure, and explain why I know more about AIDS and HIV than any Member of the House or Senate, including the three forced-out-of-privacy homosexuals that still serve in this Chamber. I know more than they do, and I know what the truth is on how to save hundreds of thousands of more young Americans, mostly males, from dying in the next decade, since we did such a pathetically poor job in educating young people on how not to kill themselves in this last decade.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/06/06/H5990_tribute-to-a-great-irish-american-and-the-terrible/'}
