The District of Columbia fire chief resigned his position. I have known Tom Tippett for a number of years. I have come to respect him and admire him, as do all of those firefighters, men and women, who serve in local 36 of the D.C. Fire Department Union.', u'Tom Tippett is a true firefighter. I first met him about 12 years ago, shortly after I first came to Congress and decided to try to work the issues involving fire and life safety in this country. To create a better awareness among our colleagues about the role of the firefighter in our inner-city areas, I started a tradition that each year would take our colleagues on a volunteer basis and have them run with one of the busiest D.C. fire stations.', u"Mr. Speaker, one of those nights we assigned a group of Members to run with Tom Tippett's station, a truck company and a rescue company that was at that time the busiest station in D.C. As Members of Congress in their jeans and shirts, with their running gear assigned by the Department, sat in the station talking to firefighters and responded throughout the evening to drug dealings, shootings, emergency trauma situations, fires, accidents, HAZMAT disasters, every kind of incident we could think of, all of us were in awe, Democrats and Republicans, of the job these people do every day.", u'Since that time, I have worked with Tom in a number of capacities. He became the President of the local here in the District of Columbia. And then when an opening occurred last year, he was offered the temporary assignment of serving as the District of Columbia Fire Chief.', u'He did an outstanding job, Mr. Speaker. When he took over the role of the chief, he said he would do it, but would have as his ultimate goal the objective of improving the life safety for the firefighters who he now had responsibility for.', u"The safety and well-being of fire fighters and EMS personnel across America is a major issue, Mr. Speaker. In fact, each year, we lose over 100 fire and EMS personnel, most of them volunteers, because the bulk of our Nation's fire fighters are volunteers, in the course of their doing their job. Over 100.", u"In fact, the D.C. Fire Department has lost three fire fighters within the last 3 years. In fact, Mr. Speaker, following a fire several years ago that took the life of one of D.C.'s finest, a fire where that life probably should have been able to be saved, a series of recommendations were made, recommendations following the death of fire fighter and Sergeant John Carter.", u"John Carter's widow was at the press conference today where we called for action to restore these cuts that were made to the D.C. fire department. John Carter was a dedicated professional. He left behind a widow and a 10-year-old son. He died in an unfortunate circumstance that probably could have been avoided, as did two of his colleagues who died almost 1 year ago in May of last year.", u"Following the death of John Carter, the Committee on Appropriations of this body in its legislative language in last year's bill put in the following item, and I will quote from this bill which is actually District of Columbia Appropriations bill for the year 2000 passed in this body on July 22, 1999. This is what it says, ``The Committee encourages the District to provide funding for two critically important safety measures that were developed by the fire department internal committee following the death of Fire Fighter John Carter 2 years ago. These safety measures include restoring the aide to the battalion chief within the fire fighting division and increasing staffing levels to at least five fire fighters on ladder companies.", u"``The mission of the fire and emergency medical services department is to improve the quality of life to those who choose to live, work, visit, and do business in the District of Columbia by preventing fires before they occur, extinguish those fires that do occur, and providing emergency medical and ambulance service.''", u'This was in the law that we passed last year in response to the death of Fire Fighter Carter.', u'Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, last year we saw two additional deaths of D.C. fire fighters. In fact, in a fire that occurred on May 30, 1999 at 3146 Cherry Road in Northeast, two fire fighters paid the ultimate price, and they left their families behind.', u'In fact, Mr. Speaker, I came down to Washington at the request of the local fire department along with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), and we joined the thousands of fire fighters, both locally and nationally, who came to pay their respects to these two brave individuals.', u'There was a second study done, Mr. Speaker, following this fire. I will enter into the Record the report of that fire from the Reconstruction Committee, as follows:', u'Incident Commanders need to follow the Incident Command System and sector every incident immediately upon arrival. This will reduce fireground confusion and allow the Incident Commander to quickly contact sector leaders to determine the locations of companies in their sectors. The Safety Officer should not conduct roll calls. Instead, a member of the Incident Command Staff (e.g., a battalion chief aide) should conduct roll calls. The Training Academy must conduct ongoing training and evaluation of fire fighters and fire officers to ensure that all Department personnel respond properly to roll calls. Roll call training must be part of recruit training, company level drills and training academy refresher courses.', u"Mr. Speaker, I will again quote from this report, although the text of it as I provided will be entered into the Record. But these are the recommendations that were made following two additional deaths of D.C. fire fighters. ``Proper management of the fireground requires the assistance of a battalion chief's aid. This position was restored on December 19, 1999'' at Chief Tippett's request. The ``Department should continue the position of battalion chief's aide and their role includes the following: Assist in the coordination of fireground activities, gather critical information for the incident commander, allow the incident commander to sector the incident sooner, handle specific tasks, such as accountability, as directed by the incident commander, improving fireground communications.", u"``The position of battalion chief's aide is important to fireground safety.''", u'Now, that was an internal recommendation of the D.C. Fire Department over the past year following the investigation of the cause of the death of these two fire fighters.', u"The report goes on to say, ``The use of battalion chief's aides greatly improves size-up information.'' On the staffing issue, this same report says the following, ``Current staffing of the Department's truck companies is inadequate. Working fires require truck company members to perform more work tasks than can be accomplished by four fire fighters in a timely manner.'' It goes on to say, ``Recommendation'', ``Truck companies must be staffed with a minimum of 5 or 6 fire fighters. Such a staffing level is nationally recognized by'' the National Fire Protection Association 1710. It goes on to say, ``This applies to all fire responses in the District of Columbia.''", u'Now, Mr. Speaker, here we have the Congress and the internal investigative arm of the District of Columbia on the record within the last year saying that we should increase the number of fire fighters on truck companies to five and that we should reinstate these aides to the battalion chief incident commander on the scene of a disaster in the District of Columbia.', u'The new fire chief put into a temporary position last year, Chief Tom Tippett, when he was sworn in said that he would protect the lives of those who he was charged to lead. The mayor supported Chief Tippett in that declaration, as did this Congress. That is exactly what Chief Tippett did.', u'Because there was not enough funding in the District of Columbia budget, he used money from the reserve account for overtime and excess dollars that he could find within the D.C. Fire Department budget to increase the staffing level and bring in these aides. So over the past several months, the District of Columbia has had better protection.', u'Unfortunately, it came to a showdown that ended in a very unfortunate decision last Friday. See, Mr. Speaker, the oversight authority for the District of Columbia, the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, headed by former Clinton OMB director Alice Rivlin, told the mayor that they could not continue to fund these positions. Even though Chief Tippett found the money within his own budget allocation when he went back in for a reprogramming to complete this fiscal year, which amounted to over a million dollars, the oversight commission said no.', u'The mayor supported the chief; and to his credit, Mayor Williams said the chief is correct. D.C. fire fighters do not deserve to be treated as second-class citizens. They protect the Congress. They protect the American people. They protect the White House. They will be out there on the streets this coming Sunday when hundreds of thousands of moms march on Washington. They were there a few short weeks ago when thousands demonstrated in support of gay rights. They are here every week when thousands and tens of thousands of citizens from all over this country come to our city.', u'The fire department responds to medical emergencies, fires, disasters, and other problems that confront this city every day.', u"Chief Tippett did what he said he would do. He increased the funding to allow that support to take place for the D.C. Fire Department. Alice Rivlin and her oversight board laid down an ultimatum and told the mayor and the chief, ``We will not support your increased funding.'' Even though the proposed budget for the District of Columbia for the next fiscal year contained an additional $6 million to fund these initiatives, the oversight board said it would not provide the emergency funding to complete the rest of this fiscal year, which would have totaled somewhere less than $4 million.", u'When Chief Tippett was backed into a corner after having given his word, which unfortunately many in politics do not abide by, but that members of the fire service do abide by their word, Chief Tippett did what he felt was the honorable thing. On Friday afternoon of last week, he resigned. He stepped down from his office because he felt that he could not justify nor guarantee the safety of the D.C. fire fighters.', u'Mr. Speaker, I can tell my colleagues that there are at least three other next in line officers who were approached about taking the interim position of D.C. fire chief, and they refused. They refused because of this common bond of honor between all the fire fighters in this city and nationwide.', u'In fact, Mr. Speaker, the irony of this whole incident is that last Wednesday evening in Washington, for the 12th time, we had over 2,000 leaders of the American fire and EMS community come to Washington for a celebration of our domestic defenders, our American heroes, our fire and emergency service providers, volunteers and paid.', u'Yet 2 days later, Chief Tippett has to resign because of a short-sighted decision made by a pencil-pushing budget cutter overseeing a budget in excess of $2 billion that could not find $4 million to help this city to be properly protected.', u'Mr. Speaker, within the last 3 years, three D.C. Fire fighters have given their lives. These fire fighters were burned. In fact, there were a couple at the fire station today on New Jersey Avenue when we had a press conference who did live who were burned. These are not pencil pushers. These are men and women who every day in this city, as their brothers and sisters do across America, respond to every type of disaster that one can think of: bomb threats, explosions, stabbings, drug dealings, because the emergency response community in this city is the D.C. Fire and Emergency Services Department. Yet tonight, Mr. Speaker, those in D.C. are less protected. Those who protect the people of D.C., the brave fire fighters and EMS personnel, are more at risk.', u'Mr. Speaker, today, at a press conference in front of the fire station on New Jersey Avenue and in this room tonight, I call for the resignation of Alice Rivlin. Anyone who is as short-sighted as she must be, to deny a $4 million request, which I, as a Republican, will aggressively support in this body, out of a budget in excess of $2 billion to help guarantee the safety of fire fighters and EMS personnel in this city, in my opinion, is not fit to be the director of the oversight management authority for this the District of Columbia.', u'Either she restores the funding or she herself should resign. As I said today, Mr. Speaker, let her take the money that she makes and the staff that supports her and give that to the D.C. Fire Department. The people of D.C. would be safer if that money were being used to protect them and the people who visit this city.', u"But, Mr. Speaker, I want to go one step further, because Alice Rivlin is the hand-picked choice of this administration. Now, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore talk a good game when it comes to supporting the Nation's fire fighters. In fact, Al Gore should talk a good game because it was the International Association of Fire Fighters who endorsed the candidacy of the Vice President before any other union in America.", u'Mr. Speaker, I ask myself where is the voice of the Vice President calling for the safety of these fire fighters? Where is his outrage that a former hand-picked senior manager of this administration would make such a disastrous decision? Yet, no word would come out of this administration about the impending problems for the safety and well-being of both the fire fighters, the emergency medical personnel, and the people who work and live in D.C.', u"Besides calling for the resignation of Alice Rivlin, I have today and I am again asking and requesting and demanding that the Vice President of the United States say something about the absolutely outrageous action that was taken by the oversight board to deny Chief Tippett's recommendations. If he does not respond, then I hope every union IAFF member in D.C. and around the country understands that that silence speaks louder than any words. We are talking about the safety of the men and women who protect this city.", u'Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, under a different administration, the New Jersey Avenue fire station was closed down, the station that protects this Capitol. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) and I fought that decision and got on this floor and tried to pass legislation to restore the funding to keep that station operational. We were unsuccessful.', u'Five years later, a few short months ago, that New Jersey Avenue station was reopened. I could not make the reopening, but the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) did, and he deserves much credit for his support in helping that station be reopened.', u'Within the first 30 days of their operation, they responded to 325 calls on Capitol Hill, 325 calls in 1 month, 30 days. Prior to that, those calls had to be answered by distance stations traveling much further to reach this Hill to take care of the citizens of America who visit and work here.', u'Today we have to respond to a different call. Chief Tippett, a brave and honorable man, gave up his profession on Friday based on principle. Now it is time for this Congress, Members from both sides of the aisle, to stand with Chief Tippett on principle.', u'Now, there are many of our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, who are railing about support for the fire service, about whether or not one is for this bill or for that bill; whether or not one is for this amendment or that amendment. Well, here is the chance for all our colleagues to join together this week and demand that the D.C. Oversight Board do the right thing and provide the additional $4 million for these brave men and women to protect this city and the people who live and work here, but more importantly to protect the lives of the fire and EMS personnel themselves.', u'It would be absolutely tragic, Mr. Speaker, if another incident like 3146 Cherry Road, Northeast, took place and additional D.C. firefighters were put at risk or, heaven forbid, lost their lives. All of us, Democrats and Republicans, must speak out and speak out loud and in a very clear and coherent voice.', u'Mr. Speaker, just a few short weeks ago tens of thousands of firefighters were joined by the President of the United States and the Vice President as they traveled to Worcester, Massachusetts, to join with all of us as we mourned the loss of six firefighters who were killed during the course of their assignment. They made the supreme sacrifice, just as the three D.C. firefighters did in the last 3 years.', u'Mr. Speaker, words are critical to console the families of those when a loved one is lost, as we all did when those six Worcester firefighters were killed. Where is the voice of those people today, before an additional D.C. firefighter is killed? Where is the voice of the President today? Where is the voice of the Vice President today? And where is the support for Alice Rivlin and the Oversight Board for the additional risks that are being put on those firefighters because they are not being adequately staffed and not being supported to respond to the incidences they have to face in this city?', u'Mr. Speaker, I hold those officials accountable. And I encourage all of our colleagues to join with me and to join with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who went to the New Jersey fire station today, before I did, to state unequivocally that we will support the funding, but we want a decision made now. Not next week, not next month, not next year, but now, to restore the full support that Chief Tippett asked for. And we also want Chief Tippett back in that job.', u"Because, as I told the mayor 3 months ago when he began his search for his chief, when I called him on the telephone, I said, ``Mayor, you know you have a good man there. Your interim chief.'' He said, ``Congressman, I agree with you.'' I said, ``He deserves to be the chief.'' And he said, ``I agree with you.'' As I sat next to the mayor last June, as we had this memorial ceremony for those two firefighters that were killed here in D.C., he said, ``You know, Congressman, my top priority as the mayor is to guarantee the safety of our emergency service workers.''", u'The mayor is then on our side. The chief is on our side. The director of public safety for the city is on our side. Where is Alice Rivlin? Where is the oversight board? Where is the White House? And where is Mr. Gore with his IAFF endorsement? What is he doing to help protect the lives of these D.C. firefighters?'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/05/08/H2644_tribute-to-dc-fire-chief-tom-tippett/'}
