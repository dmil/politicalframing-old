It is an opportunity to remember the atrocities of the past, but also a chance to recall that we must never forget. ", "Holocaust Remembrance Day pays tribute to the unbreakable will of human beings to live in freedom and oppose despotism wherever it appears. It is a reminder of that pledge to never forget and never allow the unchecked cruelty of the Holocaust to be repeated by firmly recommitting ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism, as well as all forms of persecution, bigotry, discrimination and hatred.", "In 1993, on the 50th Anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, for which Holocaust Remembrance Day was designated, then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin noted that despite the fall of Hitler ``his successors have arisen in various corners of the world.'' Sadly this statement remains true today.", "In too many regions of the world today we are still witnessing terrible mass violence, destruction and murder against women, children, ethnic and religious minorities, and lesbian, gay and transgender individuals, and many other groups of people. Reprehensibly, this violence and hatred is too often deeply institutionalized.", "Holocaust Remembrance Day serves as an opportunity to put on notice the brutal regimes carrying out these crimes that our resolve to defend universal human rights is profound and unwavering. As long as it is necessary we will continue to fight to end intolerance and work toward a more just future for all of mankind, and we stand with supreme confidence that we will be triumphant.", "The statesman and philosopher, Edmund Burke, famously said that ``The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' Today we remember the Holocaust because many good men and women stood up for justice and acted to stop Nazi cruelty, and their sacrifice must forever be honored. We remember because the spirit of humanity refused to succumb to evil and be dominated by hatred. And we remember because in remembering the past we can work toward a better future; a future of equality, freedom, peace and prosperity."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/04/13/E518-6_commemorating-holocaust-remembrance-day/"}
