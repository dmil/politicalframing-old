This proposed legislation criminalizes and punishes homosexuality, thereby endangering the lives of all Ugandans and threatening their civil and human rights. This is outrageously discriminatory and deeply troubling.", "The Anti-Homosexuality Bill was introduced as a Private Member's Bill by Ugandan Member of Parliament David Bahati of the National Resistance Movement Party on April 29, 2009. Following adoption, it was published in the Uganda Gazette on September 25, 2009, according to the procedural rules of the Ugandan Parliament. A vast majority of governments throughout the world, including the United States, continue to deny full civil rights and protections to their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, LGBT, citizens. However, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill takes this to a deadly extreme.", "This legislation condemns HIV-positive citizens, including minors, who engage in consensual homosexual acts to death and sentences citizens who engage in consensual homosexual acts to life imprisonment. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill also seeks to persecute LGBT citizens living abroad by extraditing them for acts committed outside Uganda, including those who are also dual citizens of Uganda and the United States. Furthermore, this legislation requires known homosexuals to be reported to the authorities within 24 hours; failure to do so would result in a jail term of up to 3 years. This applies to Ugandan nationals and dual citizens living abroad, as well as any person who witnesses such an act within Uganda, regardless of whether they have legal ties to the Ugandan nation. Finally, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill requires that its provisions override any commitment to international agreements or protocols that recognize the rights of LGBT persons to the extent of the inconsistency between the two. As a responsible member of the international community, the United States cannot condone such a bill becoming law.", "The Anti-Homosexuality Bill legislates against the fundamental democratic right of freedom from fear of physical harm by one's own government. This legislation would undermine the government of Uganda's commitment to democracy at a most basic level, significantly damage its relations with the international community, and risk inciting greater hate-motivated violence within Uganda itself. Its mere existence almost certainly will lead to violence against individuals who either are LGBT or are rumored to be LGBT, their families, and community leaders in their places of worship, homes, schools, and businesses.", "Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the consequences that this bill would have on public health in Uganda as it attempts to combat HIV/AIDS. The stigmatization of homosexual identity and behavior continues to stymie efforts to fight HIV/AIDS in the United States and abroad. The bill's criminalization of homosexuality will undoubtedly discourage individuals from having the open and honest discussions about their sexual health and behavior that are crucial to lessening the spread and burden of this infection.", "I commend President Obama and State Secretary Clinton for denouncing this bigoted legislation and am pleased to acknowledge that their sentiments have been publicly shared by the European Union, Canada, and other nations and international human rights groups. In addition, I also applaud those Ugandans, including Senior Advisor to President Museveni, John Nagenda, who have spoken out in opposition to this bill and urge them to fight it when Uganda's parliament enters discussions on the matter in February or March of this year.", "I am further encouraged by Secretary Clinton's commitment to protect ``the rights of the LGBT community worldwide'' and will continue working to ensure that sexual orientation and gender identity not constitute the basis for criminal penalties, harassment, or discrimination. It is my fervent hope that Congress will show a similar commitment to its own LGBT citizens as it is called upon to repeal discriminatory legislation such as ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' and the Defense of Marriage Act.", "Madam Speaker, I unequivocally condemn the Anti-Homosexuality Bill in the strongest possible terms and urge the government of Uganda to withdraw this bill and support the inalienable human rights of all people."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/01/13/E24_condemning-the-government-of-ugandas-anti-homosexu/"}
