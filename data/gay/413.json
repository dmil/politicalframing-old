Everyone knows how we have been stymied, stopped, and stunned by the procedural roadblocks of this Republican minority. So we are where we are today. No. 1, we are nearing the end of this congressional session. There is a continuing resolution that has been prepared by Senator Inouye and Senator Cochran. It has some things I don't like, but it has been done because we have to do this, and we will finish that in the immediate future.", "I am going to speak just briefly on don't ask, don't tell. But to suggest there haven't been adequate hearings on this is simply nonsensical. Senator Levin has held 2 days of hearings in the last 30 days. There have been hearings held, reports done by the military. My Republican friends have said: Well, this is something we probably should do, but why don't we have a study by the military and see what the Pentagon thinks. They did that. More than 70 percent of people who have served in the Armed Forces believe it doesn't matter at all.", "This is exemplified in a story that appears in the Las Vegas Sun newspaper today, and I will just read two paragraphs from the story:", "The Pentagon's report is done, and it concluded that repealing the law would do little to affect troop readiness. In fact, most of the troops interviewed for the report indicated they didn't think it would be a problem. The majority of them said they had served with someone who they believed to be gay or lesbian and it didn't bother them or affect their units' effectiveness.", "Mr. President, listen to this. For example, the report quotes a special operations soldier, who said, ``We have a gay guy in the unit. He's big, he's mean, and he kills lots of bad guys. No one cares that he's gay.'' That says it all. As Barry Goldwater said, you don't have to be straight to shoot straight.", "Mr. President, the DREAM Act. I first must say to everybody within the sound of my voice that I came to Washington in 1982 to serve in the House of Representatives. One of the people who came in that large Democratic class we had was Dick Durbin from Illinois. I have gotten to know him extremely well. He is very good. We all know he has the ability to express himself extremely well. I have known him for all these 28 years. We have worked very closely together. He is now the assistant leader of the Senate. I have never known him to feel so strongly about an issue as he does this DREAM Act. He worked on it for more than a decade. He has shed tears while talking to me about some of the people with whom he visits. We saw the emotion he felt here today. I so admire and appreciate him for the work he has done.", "I am committed to passing the DREAM Act. As we work toward a comprehensive approach to reform our country's broken immigration policy, one thing we can do now is ensure that the next generation can contribute to our economy and to our society.", "The DREAM Act applies to a very specific group of talented, motivated young people who already call America home. This is their home. It applies only to those who came here at age 15 or younger and have been here at least 5 years. Even then, in order to have a chance at permanent legal residency, they would have to graduate from high school, pass strict criminal background checks, and attend college or serve in the military for at least 2 years.", "I have said on this floor before--but I will repeat it--when I first became aware of the problem we had in our country, I was in Smith Valley, NV, an agricultural community in the northeastern part of our State. I was a relatively new Senator. They had gotten all the students there in a very small high school together. I made a presentation to them. When I finished, I could tell there was a girl who wanted to talk to me. She was there; I could see her and feel her presence. I knew she was embarrassed to talk to me, so I said, ``Do you want to talk to me?'' And she said, ``Yes.'' She alone said to me:", "Senator, I am the smartest kid in my class. I have the best grades. But I can't go to college. My parents came here illegally. What am I supposed to do with my life?", "At that time, I didn't know that this brilliant, young, beautiful woman of Hispanic origin could not go to college, but she could not. That is what this is all about. I don't know where that young woman is now, whether she has completed college or whether she working in the onion and garlic farms up there--I just don't know. I have thought about that many times. ", "When we jeopardize our education, we jeopardize our economy. The Congressional Budget Office found that letting these men and women contribute to our society will reduce the deficit by more than $1 billion. A UCLA study found that the DREAM Act would add as much as $3.5 trillion to our economy--that is trillion with a ``t.'' That comes from the University of California at Los Angeles. This bill is not only the right thing to do, it is also a very good investment.", "The Defense Department also knows it is good for national security. The Pentagon has said it will help it meet the recruitment goals of our All-Volunteer Force. That is why our military made it part of its 2010 to 2012 strategic plan. That is in their plan, the Pentagon's plan.", "Some Republicans are trying to demonize these young men and women, who love this country and want to contribute to it and fight for it. The real faces of the DREAM Act are the dreamers.", "I was welcomed to Washington on Thursday. There was a beautiful child there with a graduation hat on, a four-cornered hat. She was a dreamer. She wants to be able to go to college. That is all she wants. And we have others who want to be able to join the military.", "The real faces belong to people such as Astrid Silva, who wrote to me from Nevada to tell me this--and I have visited her on many occasions:", "I am 22 and have never even stolen a piece of gum from a 7- 11; yet, I feel as though my forehead says ``felon.''", "Ricardo Cornejo wrote to me from Las Vegas to tell me that young men like him ``would love to fight and give our entire lives for our country.''", "Opponents use the word ``amnesty,'' hoping to trick people into thinking this bill is something it is not. They are trying to play to people's worst fears.", "One Senator said in the presence of one of these dreamers that he could not vote for it because that law said one didn't need to serve. All you need to do is sign up. I say to this U.S. Senator and anyone else suggesting such an absurdity: Read the bill. It takes 2 years of service in the military. It will be longer than 2 years because you have to sign up for more than 2 years. We certainly get our money's worth in that regard. The DREAM Act could not be further from amnesty. It is an opportunity that gives nothing for free and demands a great deal of those who earn legal residency. It is not granting citizenship immediately; it puts them on the pathway to citizenship. It gives nobody incentives to break the law but to contribute to our Nation and its economy.", "When it passes--Mr. President, I hope it passes, as my friend Senator Durbin said today, but it is going to pass--millions of children who grew up in America as Americans will be able to get the education they need to contribute to our economy. Many who have volunteered to defend our country will no longer have to fear being deported.", "Democrats know this is good policy. Republicans know it too. That is why Senator Orrin Hatch coauthored it 10 years ago, and that is why the Wall Street Journal's very conservative editorial board called it a worthy immigration bill within the last few weeks. The only question is whether we will let good policy inform our votes or let partisan politics get in the way of so many futures--not just of these children but our own."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/S10663_recognition-of-the-republican-leader/"}
