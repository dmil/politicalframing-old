That caucus takes as its responsibility sort of a checks and balance for human rights violations around the world. That is why I rise today with such pain about our own situation here in the United States of America.", "Last evening many of us joined with throngs to mourn the loss of Matthew Shepard, the young man who died in Wyoming as the result of a brutal and devastating murder. Matthew Shepard was gay, but he was also, as was claimed and was pronounced last evening, filled with vitality and life. He loved life; small in stature, but well worth the value of his life and, as well, the opportunity to continue to live his life.", "My sympathy goes to Judy and Dennis, his parents, and all of his friends in the State of Wyoming. But frankly, the brutal attack against Mr. Shepard is not an uncharacteristic once-in-a-lifetime manifestation of hatred. It happens too many times in this country.", "During 1985, 7,947 bias-motivated criminal incidents were reported to the FBI by approximately 9,600 law enforcement agencies in 45 States and the District of Columbia. Sixty-one percent of the incidents were motivated by racial bias, 16 percent by religious bias, 13 percent by sexual orientation, and the remainder by ethnicity, national origin bias, or multiple biases. The 7,947 incidents involved 9,895 separate offenses, 10,469 victims, and 8,433 offenders.", "I would say, Mr. Speaker, that in these waning hours, there should be nothing more to dictate to us that we should pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998. Let me thank the President for so quickly denouncing both the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, but as well, calling on this Congress to pass this legislation. Allow me to thank those negotiators in these last hours who are negotiating on this final omnibus bill who have pressed over and over again, why can we not pass a Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998?", "Let me ask my colleagues, why not, in the name of James Baird, an African American in Jasper, Texas, who was dismembered a few months ago out of hatred, or Fred Mangione, in Houston, Texas, who was killed because of his sexual orientation? How many more deaths do we need to tolerate to be able to pass a Federal law that stands up to the Nation and says, we will tolerate hatred no more? We will not accept the intolerance of not tolerating those who are different.", "What is wrong with this Nation, in a unified voice, promoting laws that protect people who are different because of their religious difference, their racial difference, whether or not they have disabilities, their sexual orientation, or their gender?", "I have been asked over and over again, why create other laws? Do we not have murder, assault, and other laws that will take charge of these issues? I simply say that the question has to be asked, what kind of moral standing does this Nation want to have?", "Certainly, there are State laws dealing with murder and assault, and there are State laws dealing with rape and other types of incidents. But the State laws are disorganized, and many of our States have not passed hate crimes legislation, including the State of Wyoming. Some States who have made a good-faith effort find that their legislation is overbroad and vague, and therefore it is not a valuable tool for prosecutors.", "In talking to U.S. attorneys who would have to prosecute this law, this Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998, they say it clearly answers the question of preciseness, because it delineates those who would be covered by such a law. It enhances the sentencing for those who would perpetrate violence because others are different.", "Do we want to live in a country that accepts a random, reckless attack because you happen to be an African American walking along a lonely road, or you happen to be someone of a different sexual orientation who is sitting in a bar, minding his or her own business, engaging in what most Americans would like to do, enjoying themselves?", "Do we want to be a Nation who points the finger at others who are violating human rights, and yet we do not have the courage to stand up and pass legislation, simple as it might be, in order to protect those who are different?", "I call upon my colleagues in these last hours of this session, if we do anything as we have done to help our children and others, can we not stand up for human rights and human justice? Can we not pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998? I hope the answer is a resounding ``yes.''"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/15/H10989_urging-members-to-support-legislation-regarding-ha/"}
