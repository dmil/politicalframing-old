Lamar University's JoAnne Gay Dishman Department of Nursing has taken this philosophy and ran with it. Their continued excellence has turned the nursing program into one of the most successful in the country.", u"Nursing education began at Lamar University in 1974. Since then, it has become the second most popular in the university, trailing only General Studies. From 2001 through 2005, the program saw a 30 percent increase in the number of students admitted to the program. Over the same period, the number of pre-nursing majors increased by 195 percent. The popularity stems from the success of both the program and the students. The faculty is staffed by a number of experts with many years of experience. Recently Department Chair Eileen Curl was elected president of the Texas Association of Deans and Directors of Professional Nursing Programs. May 2007 graduates of the Department's associate of applied science program achieved a 100 percent passing rate on the National Council Licensing Examination for Registered Nurses. The national passing rate is 87 percent. Success in the classroom has lead to success after graduation. The University states that 98 percent of senior nursing students have job offers before graduation, and a full 100 percent are employed within six months after graduation. The knowledge learned in the classroom benefits all Southeast Texans, as the University estimates that between 60 to 80 percent of Lamar's graduating classes are employed in local health care agencies. Southeast Texans can feel safe, knowing that they have qualified, competent, and professional nurses to assist them.", u"Lamar University's Dishman Department of Nursing had humble beginnings but quickly grew to become one of the most popular and distinguished majors. The faculty provides quality education relevant to today's ever-changing world. The students strive to be the best and showcase their values, work ethic and integrity. With an enrollment that grows by the year, the Dishman Department of Nursing will be turning out prominent medical professionals for years to come.", u"And that's just the way it is."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/11/15/E2439_recognizing-lamar-universitys-dishman-department-o/'}
