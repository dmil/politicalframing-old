It appears that some would condemn us to repeating history.", "The only saving grace for this measure is that it is doomed to failure, and the President knows that. This amendment is being considered merely to throw red meat at conservative voters in an election year. Just over a month before the 2004 election, when his poll numbers were slipping, the President stated his support for this discriminatory measure. He knew the amendment could not pass in Congress and that there was minimal public support for it. Republicans moved this discriminatory bill for the sole purpose of dividing voters and inciting anti-gay sentiment in a hotly-contested election year.", "Two years later, the Republicans are drowning in corruption and losing public support on a mass scale. The White House wants to drive its conservative base to the polls and has asked the Senate Majority Leader to bring this issue before the full Senate. Make no mistake about it, we will win this fight again.", "Then, hopefully we can turn to the issues that the American people want the government to address. We have yet to investigate the Administration's failed policy in Iraq that has led to the deaths of over 2,000 American soldiers. We need to know why there has been a steep rise in gas prices during a time of record oil industry profits. We need to craft a prescription drug bill for seniors that works instead of keeping one that confuses seniors and rewards large pharmaceutical companies. We need to stop borrowing money from foreign countries, cease deficit spending, and return our economy to the surpluses it had under President Clinton.", "With so many critical issues that need the immediate attention of the Congress, Republicans need to reevaluate their priorities. It is my hope that in the coming months we can focus our energies on the many important issues facing our country rather than on divisive and unproductive distractions."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/06/06/E1023_republican-misguided-priorities/"}
