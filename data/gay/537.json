They spend months researching schools and visiting campuses in an effort to find the perfect fit. At the top of the list of characteristics students and their parents look for in a school is a safe learning environment. Information is the key to choosing such an environment. Under current law, students and their parents do not have access to all the information necessary to make an informed choice.', u'Current law requires colleges and universities to report statistics on crimes that occur on their campuses. However, colleges are only required to report those hate crimes that result in murder, rape, or aggravated assault. These three categories of crimes only represent 16 percent of the total number of hate crimes that occur on college campuses every year. Vandalism, harassment, and simple assault comprise the vast majority of hate crimes. Under current law, however, colleges are not required to report these crimes.', u'Current law also does not require colleges and universities to report hate crimes against women and the disabled. Thus, parents of daughters or disabled students have no idea whether the college to which they will send their children is safe.', u'Students and parents have the right to information about all hate crimes committed on their prospective college campuses. My bill, the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, will ensure that they have access to that information.', u'The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act does two very important things: it expands college reporting requirements to include all hate crimes, not just those that result in murder, rape and aggravated assault; and, it includes gender and disability in the class protected by the reporting requirement. Under current law, colleges need only report hate crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. My bill will cover these four categories plus gender and disability.', u"Our Nation's college campuses should be a refuge from crime, particularly heinous attacks motivated by hatred and bigotry. The disturbing truth, however, is that college campuses are often fertile ground for bigotry. A recent study done by the Maryland Prejudice Institute reported that 25 percent of minority college students attending predominantly white colleges have been victimized by hate. In 1996, 90 incidents of anti-Semitic activity on college campuses were reported to the Anti-Defamation League.", u'In September 1996, 60 Asian-American college students at a California university received threats from another student via e-mail messages threatening that all Asian-Americans would be hunted and killed. Under current law, this offense would not appear on a campus crime report.', u'The Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act will provide students and their parents with vital information so that they may better protect themselves against such crimes. It will also encourage college officials to raise awareness about these crimes and develop programs and strategies to combat them.', u"The damage done by hate crimes goes beyond physical injury. Hate crimes, whether they take the form of painting a swastika on someone's dorm room door or gang beating a student believed to be gay, leave the victim feeling fearful, vulnerable, and isolated.", u'Our children are our future. Their college years are among the most exciting and formative of their lives. By introducing the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, I hope to empower students and parents with all of the information necessary to ensure that those years are as safe as possible.', u'Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that the text of the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act of 1997, in its entirety, be printed in the Record.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/11/09/S12291-2_statements-on-introduced-bills-and-joint-resolutio/'}
