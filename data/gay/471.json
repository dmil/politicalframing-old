Lowery, pastor of Saint Timothy Community Church in Gary, IN. On Tuesday, July 10, 2007, Reverend Lowery passed away at the University of Chicago Medical Center at the age of 82. A constant fixture in the community, Reverend Lowery understood how to communicate with all people. For this, Reverend Lowery appropriately earned the nickname, ``Everyman's Preacher.''", u"Robert E. Lowery was born on the west side of Chicago. An accomplished scholar, he obtained degrees in theology from the Chicago Theological Seminary, the Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, IL, and a Bachelor of Science degree from George Williams College in Chicago. Though Chicago was his home, he eventually relocated to Gary, Indiana and took over as pastor of Saint Timothy Community Church in 1957. For the past 50 years, Reverend Lowery has called Gary his home, and the impact he has had on his congregation and the entire community will forever be remembered. Under his leadership, Saint Timothy has grown to become one of the city's largest congregations with over 1,600 members.", u"Reverend Lowery's lifetime of service to his community goes far beyond his pastoral duties. Knowing that preaching was only a small part of the impact he could have on people's lives, Reverend Lowery became actively involved in many local organizations. Realizing the need to reach people at an early age, he dedicated himself to programs aimed at improving the lives of the youth in the community and enhancing their opportunities to lead successful lives. Reverend Lowery felt a tremendous responsibility to reach out to the youth, and it was for this reason that he became active in the Boy Scouts of America. Fully dedicated to the mission of the Boy Scouts, Reverend Lowery served as Scoutmaster for Troop 53 at Saint Timothy, and he also served as an executive board member of the Calumet Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Reverend Lowery's generosity and commitment to the children of Northwest Indiana will forever be remembered by the children he mentored.", u"Recognized for his work in his community, Reverend Lowery was the recipient of many awards, both local and national. While it would be impossible to name them all, Reverend Lowery's efforts led to him being honored with the prestigious Drum Major Award, presented by the Gary Frontiers Service Club in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and his most worthy induction into Gary's Steel City Hall of Fame in 1990.", u'Reverend Lowery leaves to cherish his memory three daughters: Gay Marlene Lowery, Jan Avis Lowery, and Lynn Michele Lowery-Darby, as well as an entire community whose lives have been improved by such a caring and benevolent friend and mentor.', u"Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Reverend Dr. Robert E. Lowery for his outstanding devotion to his congregation and to all of Northwest Indiana. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to the people he served is worthy of the highest commendation. Reverend Lowery's selflessness was an inspiration to us all. While the entire community is saddened by his passing, his message will live on through the many lives he has touched."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/07/13/E1515-2_tribute-to-rev-dr-robert-e-lowery/'}
