Mr. Kelly lost his battle with a strep infection on May 26, 2007.", "Born and raised in Port Chester, New York, Mr. Kelly enlisted in the United States Navy at age 17 to serve in WWII. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1950 and remained in South Bend to work in broadcasting until 1972. At WSBT-TV, Mr. Kelly served as the news anchor and the news director. Though a natural in front of the camera, Mr. Kelly began a new career at the local bank where he served as the Vice President and Director of Marketing, and he would retire as the Director of Business Development. Throughout his life, he dedicated himself to bettering the community through volunteering and mentoring.", "Mr. Kelly was a member of many boards and committees, but most notably he sat on the South Bend Common Council as Vice-President until his death. Described as the ``peacemaker'' by fellow council members, he sponsored an anti-gun ordinance in 1991 and was instrumental in including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people in anti-discrimination laws. Mr. Kelly was also influential in revamping a tax abatement ordinance which has fostered millions of dollars of new investment in our community. Committees he sat on included the Information and Technology committee and the Community and Economic Development committee, and he was chairperson of the Community Relations committee. For his dedication to the community, Mr. Kelly was inducted into the South Bend Community Hall of Fame in 2001.", "Our community has lost a beloved family member, generous friend, devoted father, doting grandfather, and Notre Dame's most enthusiastic fan. He was described as a ``ham at heart'' and was often seen performing in theatre and music groups. Off-stage, Mr. Kelly never missed an opportunity to share a witty story.", "Mr. Kelly leaves behind three children, seven grandchildren, a great-grandson, and countless friends. His ever-present energy and humor will be dearly missed. It is with great pride that I celebrate the life and service of Roland Kelly."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/06/11/E1250-5_celebrating-the-life-of-roland-kelly-of-south-bend/"}
