Among the dead in the crash of SwissAir flight 111 was a special couple, Dr. Jonathan Mann and Dr. Mary Lou Clement Mann. Both devoted their lives to finding a cure for AIDS, and today I join thousands of people all over this country and across the world in mourning the tragedy of SwissAir flight 111 and the loss of everyone on board. Jonathan and Mary Lou Clement Mann selflessly gave of themselves and cared for patients from Zaire to New Mexico, Boston to Geneva, embodying the best of their profession by bringing hope and comfort to countless individuals and families.", "Jonathan Mann was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1947 and graduated from Harvard College in 1969. After attending the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, he returned to Boston for his formal entry into the medical profession. In 1975 he joined the Centers for Disease Control as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, and from 1977 to 1984 he was the State Epidemiologist and Chief Medical Officer for the state of New Mexico.", "After receiving his Masters in Public Health from Harvard University in 1980, Dr. Mann returned to the CDC and it was then that AIDS became his primary, professional focus. During these years he established and directed the Zaire AIDS Research Project, which conducted the first comprehensive study of the disease on the continent where AIDS has brought the most widespread devastation and suffering. Dr. Mann's work there led him to the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS in 1986, a post of global impact which he held until his return to Harvard's School of Public Health in 1990.", "Dr. Mann's involvement in this issue was total; his life and the fight to find a cure for AIDS soon became, in everyone's eyes, synonymous. Beyond his professional service to the cause, he participated in the AIDS Walk in Boston, World AIDS Day, and countless events, workshops, symposiums and conferences. His ultimate foe was the stigma that was attached to AIDS victims. His only weapons in the fight against AIDS were his passion, his intellect, and his belief in the truth, and with those tools he was well armed to fight his battle on the fields not just of science, but against a public that too often fell short of the compassion and humanity that a war on AIDS required. Dr. Mann was not afraid to declare that AIDS will not be beaten as long as we stigmatize those that fall victim to it. He was one of the first and unfortunately few researchers who took AIDS seriously in the infancy of the epidemic, when AIDS was still called GRIDS--gay-related immunodeficiency syndrome. Jonathan and Mary Lou Mann understood that AIDS was a challenge for every community in this country and he was not afraid to speak out and criticize anyone--an administration, a society, an entire nation--who denied that truth.", "Dr. Mann's work echoed from the best of human instincts: to reach out to those in need and to wield his power to alleviate suffering. We mourn the loss of Dr. Jonathan Mann and his wife Dr. Mary Lou Mann. On behalf of Massachusetts, the United States Senate, and all those who were fortunate enough to know these two gifted individuals, we remember them for their energy, their compassion for others, and realize that the world is better off for their time on this earth.
