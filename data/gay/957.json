In politics, as in life, you can only achieve greatness by building on the path that those before you have taken.", "Tom was a mentor to me, a friend, a confidante. Tom Manton truly loved serving here in this institution, with his friends on both sides of the aisle. I will truly miss his friendship, and our city and our State of New York will miss his leadership.", "My condolences go out to his wife, Diane, and to all his children and his grandchildren on the passing of their husband, their father and their grandfather.", "Tom Manton was born in New York City in 1932. He was the son of a working class Irish immigrant. His father actually worked here on Capitol Hill as a plasterer, laying plaster in the Longworth Building. He often talked about that historical note. He would often say only in America can a son of someone who built the halls of Congress one day serve in the halls of Congress.", "Tom Manton went on to law school at the St. John's University where he got his law degree, but before that, he was a police officer, a computer salesman, and after law school was elected to the New York City Council in 1969, representing what are still parts of today the 7th congressional district that I have the honor of serving in.", "In 1986, after the death of Donald Manes, Tom Manton stepped up and filled the role as chair of the County of Queens Democratic Party. When our party in Queens was at its lowest ebb, Tom Manton took the reins of control and brought back the image of Democrats in Queens County and in New York City and New York State. He instilled discipline from time to time, which is part of the role of a county leader, but he worked to make the party the preeminent political party, not only of New York City and New York State, but many would argue our Nation today.", "Presidential candidates, from Mike Dukakis and Dick Gephardt and Fritz Mondale and Bob Kerry, Bill Clinton, and John Kerry, all sought his support and the support of Queens Democrats to help propel them to higher office and, in the instance of Bill Clinton, successfully helping to make him President of the United States.", "But Tom has helped elected officials at every level achieve their goals, the firsts of firsts in many respects: the first Indian political leader, under his tutelage; the first Bangladeshi American political leader, under his tutelage; the first Latino from Queens to the New York State assembly; the first openly gay political leader; the first woman as Borough president; and the first African American woman as Borough president; and the list goes on and on.", "Tom always had the bug for Congress and ran in 1972 against an incumbent, James Delaney. He lost that election, but he also ran again in 1978 against Geraldine Ferraro. Once again, he lost, but he did not let that keep him down. When Geraldine Ferraro was tapped by Walter Mondale to run as his running mate in 1984, Tom took the opportunity to run for and finally win a seat in Congress.", "In Congress, he was an inside political player who earned a seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. He fought tenaciously through this committee for the interests of New York, bringing countless jobs and Federal resources to his district.", "One of his major accomplishments was the establishment of the Ad-Hoc Committee of Irish Affairs which he used as a forum to represent one of the largest communities of Irish immigrants in the United States.", "As co-chair of this committee, he worked closely with President Clinton to urge him to grant a visa to Gerry Adams, and this began the peace process that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.", "As a friend and a mentor, I have to say, in addition to being a caring husband, grandfather, and father, Tom was a dear friend to many. In 1984, my uncle, Walter Crowley, ran against Tom Manton in that open primary seat that I spoke of earlier. I worked very hard for my Uncle Walter in that campaign, and I remember vividly the heartbreaking loss my Uncle endured and that I felt myself. Tom Manton was an unspoken name in our household. It was a bad word. You couldn't say that name.", "But not long after that, Tom Manton tapped me on the shoulder at the County Cork Association dance on Greenpoint Avenue, and he said to me, how would you like to be the next assemblyman from the 30th assembly district? Why don't you think about getting in that primary. And I did. I won a subway primary, with his support and under his tutelage. In 1998, I was proud to succeed him here in Congress as the Congressman from the Seventh Congressional District.", "I know how proud Tom was to serve in this Congress, and I know how proud I am of the work that he did here, and I am proud to succeed him here in Congress to this day. There is not a day that I am not grateful for the opportunities that Tom Manton created for me and for my life.", "To Tom's wife, Diane; to his four children, Cathy Manton Laurent of Schenectady, Tom Manton of London, John Manton of Woodside, Queens, and Jeanne of Astoria; and to his four grandchildren, Nicole, Marc, Danielle, and Liam Henry, and incidentally, Liam Henry, Tom would always remind me, is the same name of my son and how it was a great coincidence that he and I would share that as well. It was something that in this last year particularly he would always point out to me, and it brought a chuckle to him and to me as well. I want you all to know that Tom, your granddad, your father, and your husband, is in our thoughts and in our prayers.", "But more importantly, Diane, you and your children and your grandchildren are in all the prayers of the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.", "I have to say for the record, I loved Tom Manton, and he is not the kind of guy you would say that to. I didn't have to say it to him. He knew it. There was an unspoken language between the two of us. He knew how I felt about him, and I certainly knew how he felt about me. He showed it in so many ways.", "I will miss my good friend, my mentor, Tom Manton, as I know his law partners will, as his community will. His legacy will live on in so many people but especially in this Member of Congress.", "Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record the Associated Press article regarding Tom Manton's death.", "Washington--Thomas Manton, a former congressman who for years wielded his influence to shape New York City's political landscape, has died. He was 73. The seven-term congressman died Saturday, said Rep. Joseph Crowley, who took Manton's Queens congressional seat when he retired. Crowley declined to discuss the cause of death but Michael Reich, the Queens Democratic Party's executive secretary and Manton's spokesman, told the (New York) Daily News that Manton died of an undisclosed and lengthy illness. Elected 20 years ago to his post as Queens Democratic Party chair, Manton was known as a behind-the-scenes politician who fostered the careers of City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and other local political figures. When he announced his retirement from Congress in 1998, he successfully hand-picked Crowley, then a state assemblyman, as his successor, and he played a role in the selection of the two most recent City Council speakers. ``He was a great man and a great friend and he'll be terribly missed,'' Crowley said Sunday. ``He's left the Queens Democratic party in a very strong position.'' New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he had reached out to Manton when he first began considering entering politics. ``He was a classy guy. It's a sad day,'' said the Republican mayor, a former Democrat. ``We really did lose someone who made a difference.'' Manton served 15 years on the New York City Council before taking over Geraldine Ferraro's congressional seat when she ran for vice president in 1984. As a congressman, he had little problem getting re-elected, winning with 87 percent of the vote in 1994. He said his years as a city councilman made him sensitive to the needs of constituent service and set the tone for his congressional career, which was focused on local concerns and New York City politics. As the head of the county party, he helped choose the city's leaders and, Crowley said, helped open up the party leadership to minority groups. ``He was a steady rudder of the ship who brought the Queens party back from its lowest ebb. He diversified the leadership of the county, welcoming minority leaders,'' said Crowley. Born in 1932 to Irish immigrant parents in Manhattan, Manton carved a colorful career path, serving as a New York City police officer, an IBM salesman and a flight navigator for the U.S. Marine Corps. He worked as a lawyer for decades, reportedly retiring just months before his death."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/07/24/H5659-3_honoring-former-member-of-congress-thomas-j-manton/"}
