The major condition was that a vacancy would occur during the course of the recess. This goes back to the horse-and-buggy days when we were in session for 2 or 3 months at a time and then we were gone. So if someone such as the Secretary of State would die in office, it would allow the President to replace that person without having to go through the advice and consent.", "Throughout the years, both Democrat and Republican Presidents have abused this. They have made recess appointments. In 1985, President Reagan made quite a few of them. The majority at that time, the Democrats, under the majority leadership of Senator Byrd from West Virginia, made the determination that he was making too many recess appointments.", "He challenged the President to submit a letter that would outline future recess appointments during the Reagan administration. In 1985, a letter was sent from President Reagan to then-majority leader, Senator Byrd from West Virginia that stated no more recess appointments would take place unless the names of the individuals who were considered for recess appointment were submitted in writing in sufficient time in advance that the majority or minority leaders could take some type of action.", "For example, if they were going to have someone recess appointed for the express purpose of avoiding the advice and consent of the Senate, then they would just not go into recess; they would go into pro forma, where they would have someone in the Chair all the time to make sure that did not happen. Also, it would be an opportunity to make sure they were not doing it for the express purpose of avoiding advice and consent.", "Last May, there was an appointment during the recess of James Hormel to be Ambassador to Luxembourg. There were several people who were opposed to his appointment and had holds on his appointment. The major reason was not that he was a gay activist, but he had not submitted the appropriate financial information to the appropriate committee for consideration. The President went ahead and appointed him.", "Consequently--that was already done, and there was no attempt to undo it even though it was contrary to the Constitution--I sent a letter to the President asking him if he would agree to the same thing Ronald Reagan agreed to back in 1985. Of course, I did not get a very favorable response. However, I said: In the event I do not do that, I will put a hold on every nondefense or nonmilitary appointment or nominee from the President. And I did so.", "The weeks went by, and finally I got a letter from the President that said:", "I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my administration will follow.", "I have been concerned because this President has a long history of doing things he says he is not going to do and not doing things he says he will do. Consequently, I sent a letter to the President which I submitted for the Record last Wednesday. The letter was dated November 10, signed by myself and 16 other Senators, that said: Make sure you comply with the spirit of this agreement, this letter you have sent; we are going to serve notice right now that in the event you have recess appointments that do not comply with the spirit of the letter, we will put holds for the remaining of the term of your Presidency on all of the judicial nominees. A very serious thing. I repeated this several times last Wednesday to make sure there was no misunderstanding.", "Since that time, the White House has cooperated and submitted a list of 13 names. I will read these names and the positions for which they have been nominated: Cliff Stuart, EEOC; Delmond Won, Commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission; Leonard Page, general counsel for the Labor Relations Board; Luis Laurado, Development Bank; Mark Schneider, Peace Corps; Frank Holleman, Deputy Secretary of Education; Mike Walter, Veterans Administration; Mr. Jeffers, whose first name I do not have, J-E-F-F-E-R-S; Bill Lann Lee, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights; Sally Katzen, Deputy Director of OMB; John Holum, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security of the Department of State; Carl Spielvogel, Ambassador to the Slovak Republic; and Jay Johnson--not to be confused with the military Jay Johnson--a nominee for the U.S. Mint.", "Of this list of 13, there are 5 who either have holds on them or there are intended holds on these individuals. Consequently, I make the statement at this time--and I think it is very important the Record reflect this accurately and everyone understands it thoroughly--that anyone other than the names I will read off--Cliff Stuart, Delmond Won, Leonard Page, Luis Laurado, Mark Schneider, Frank Holleman, Mike Walker, Mr. Jeffers--if there are any names that are submitted and are sought to be appointed during this recess, recess appointments, we, who undersigned the letter on the 10th of this month, will put a hold on every judicial nominee who comes before the Senate during the entire remainder of the term of President Clinton.", "I am going to repeat that because it is very important. Any name, other than these eight names I just read, who is recess appointed, if anyone other than these eight individuals is recess appointed, we will put a hold on every single judicial nominee of this President for the remainder of his term of office. That means specifically we will not agree to Bill Lann Lee, Sally Katzen, John Holum, Carl Spielvogel, and Jay Johnson.", "I will conclude with that. I reemphasize, if there is some other interpretation as to the meaning of the letter, it does not make any difference, we are still going to put the holds on them. I want to make sure there is a very clear understanding, if these nominees come in, if he does violate the intent as we interpret it, then we will have holds on these nominees.", "I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/11/19/S15059-2_recess-appointments/"}
