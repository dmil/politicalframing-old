Twenty years ago we called it GRID--Gay Related Immune Disease. Based on that designation and the politicization of the disease, this country spent the first 10 years blaming the victims and denying the necessity for concerted action.', u'And while we debated, in the U.S. 400,000 people have died and more than a million have been infected. However, not only citizens in the U.S. have suffered. HIV has claimed the lives of more than 21 million people worldwide, with Sub-Sahara Africa representing the greatest number of victims.', u'But we have managed some progress in the last twenty years. We have medications that have demonstrated some success in stemming the suffering and prolonging lives. We have come to learn about the progression of the disease and the link between malnutrition, poverty and the progression of opportunistic infections. And we have managed to teach people in all walks of life about the methods of transmission and prevention. So twenty years after it first appeared in the U.S. much has happened, but much remains to be done. We must continue domestic and international prevention efforts. We must continue funding the search for a vaccine. We must continue research into promising treatments.', u'However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Much remains to be done. HIV/AIDS has become a global pandemic which threatens the lives of millions of people. The United Nations has estimated that by the year 2010, there will be 40 million children in Africa who will be orphaned by AIDS. Currently, there are 10 million AIDS orphans on the continent of Africa. What have we done and what have we failed to do for these children? Will we continue to deny the magnitude of the problem like we did 20 years ago or will we step forward and be the international leader that we have always claimed? If we learn nothing else from AIDS, let us learn this--because viruses are not respecters of persons, we must learn to compassionately care for everyone infected and affected. Our failure to do this 20 years ago brought us to where we are today. What will our continued failure to act bring about in another 20 years? Can these children count on us for help or will we blame them like we did so many others in years past?'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/06/07/E1045-4_aids-epidemic/'}
