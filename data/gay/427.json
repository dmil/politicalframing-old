This woman of great passion, compassion, vitality, kindness, and commitment died after a long battle with cancer in San Diego, CA, where she had lived and worked for the past 20 years.", "I first heard of Midge in 1976, when President-elect Jimmy Carter made history by making her the first woman ever named Assistant to the President. As President Carter's public liaison, she reached out to Americans who had previously been denied access to the White House.", "By the time I first ran for Senate in 1992, Midge had moved to San Diego, where she worked tirelessly on behalf of my campaign. She ran our San Diego office, introduced me to local leaders, and often spoke on my behalf at rallies and other speaking engagements. She was a riveting speaker who inspired even the toughest crowd.", "The daughter of Sicilian immigrants, Midge was born in 1932 in LeRoy, NY, and grew up in Rochester. After high school, she went to work and became active in several community organizations. Soon she was volunteering for Democratic political campaigns, including Averell Harriman's successful campaign for governor of New York. In 1964, she served as the Monroe County director for Robert F. Kennedy's Senate campaign.", "Midge served a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1972 to 1977. In 1973, she ran for an at-large seat on the Rochester City Council and won in a landslide. In 1974, she lost a congressional race to a popular Republican incumbent. Two years later, she served as State cochair for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign. At the 1976 Democratic National Convention, she gave an inspiring speech seconding Carter's nomination.", "After leaving the White House, Midge served on the board of directors for several organizations, including the National Gay Rights Advocates and the AIDS research group Search Alliance.", "Following my 1992 campaign, Midge worked on the 1994 campaigns of gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown and Congresswoman Lynn Schenk. Over the years, she also coached many candidates in strategy and public speaking.", "In 2000, she was appointed Special Assistant to the Governor by California Governor Gray Davis and served as his liaison for women's groups and issues.", "Since 2003, Midge has been an adjunct professor at San Diego State University and established the Midge Costanza Institute for the Study of Politics and Public Policy at SDSU.", "For the past 5 years, Midge has served as public affairs officer for San Diego district attorney Bonnie Dumanis. Last year, when she and the district attorney visited my Washington office, we shared some laughs and stories about our early days together.", "Shortly before Midge died, she received a call from President Carter, who expressed his love for her and his gratitude for her outstanding service to the Nation. Today I want to echo those sentiments and bid a fond farewell to my dear friend Midge Costanza. Midge was a great role model for women in public service. Her insight and wit will be missed by all of us who knew her. "], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/03/25/S2111-2_additional-statements/"}
