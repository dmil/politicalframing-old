James Barton ``Mickey'' Vernon, a native of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, passed away on September 24, 2008, having lived a life of great success and purpose. Today is the anniversary of his birthday.", u"Long before he became an exceptional professional baseball player, Mickey Vernon's character and work ethic were shaped by his parents, Clarence and Katherine Morris Vernon, his sister, Edith, and the good people of Marcus Hook, the cornerstone of Pennsylvania.", u"In addition, he benefited from the dedicated faculty and coaches of Eddystone High School and Villanova University. Ranked among the best players of baseball's golden era, Mickey was twice the American League's batting champ and, over a career that included time with the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Milwaukee Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates, he played in 2,409 Major League games. In each, he played with skill, determination, and a complete commitment to his team and teammates.", u"More important than his skills on the diamond, Mickey Vernon stands apart for his modesty and unfailing service to our Nation and to our community. I am especially proud to call him ``shipmate.'' Mickey Vernon served in the U.S. Navy during World War II in the brutally hot and dangerous South Pacific. Following that conflict, he continued his brilliant career, and with his lovely wife, Anne, raised a lovely daughter, Gay.", u'In a year when the Seventh Congressional District lost both Mickey Vernon and Harry Kalas, there is a temptation to feel great pain and sadness, that is understandable; but it is more in keeping with the lives of both men that we celebrate their greatness and decency.', u"I ask that our Chamber and our Nation pause to honor James Barton ``Mickey'' Vernon as a model athlete, a veteran, husband, father and friend, an inspiration to us all. He was some man."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/04/22/H4670-4_honoring-james-barton-mickey-vernon/'}
