Dr. Lowery will be honored by St. Timothy Church during a 3-day anniversary celebration, which will include a gala banquet to be held at St. Timothy Community Church on Saturday, September 27, 1997, at 6 p.m. The banquet, which is entitled ``A Tribute: The Man and His Message,'' will be in honor of Dr. Lowery's service to his parish, as well as his demonstrated commitment to improving the communities of northwest Indiana.", u'On September 27, 1957, Dr. Lowery began his ministry at St. Timothy Community Church as an interim pastor armed with several degrees and an enthusiasm for serving the community. With a masters of divinity from Garret Theological Seminary and a doctorate of ministry from Chicago Theological Seminary, Dr. Lowery was well prepared for the self-defined role he would accept to spiritually guide, sustain, and shepherd the members of his parish and community. Since his arrival at St. Timothy Community Church, Dr. Lowery has devoted his time to providing guidance and training for the youth of northwest Indiana, planning and supporting positive urban initiatives, and addressing crucial issues related to education, health care, crime, and teenage pregnancy.', u'Dr. Lowery has carried out his youth-, education-, and urban-development-oriented agenda through his voluntarism with a number of prominent community service organizations. Currently, Dr. Lowery serves on the board of directors for the Northwest Indiana Boys and Girls Club, an organization which provides educational, social, and recreational services for young people, supports the Marion Home, a residential facility for young pregnant women, and is a Scoutmaster for Gary Boy Scout Troop 53. Through his work with such distinguished organizations as the Gary Educational Development Foundation and the Northwest Indiana Urban League, he has been instrumental in structuring a comprehensive framework for educational programs, which divert the energies of youth into productive activities. Dr. Lowery has also aided urban development during his tenure as an executive board member for the Northwest Indiana Urban League, Referral Emergency Services, and the Lake County Mental Health Association. In addition to faithfully serving numerous other organizations, Dr. Lowery holds an associate professorship at Indiana University-Northwest, where he teaches in the area of church society and psycho-dynamics of minority problems.', u"Over the years, Dr. Lowery has been recognized by a number of institutions for his outstanding commitment to northwest Indiana communities. As a result of his theological and humanitarian efforts, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Purdue University-Calumet in 1996, and an honorary doctorate of divinity from the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1991. In addition, he has received countless awards for his community service efforts from such organizations as the Boy Scouts of America, the NAACP, the March of Dimes, and the Lake Area United Way. Some of the more prominent service honors bestowed upon Dr. Lowery include the 1990 State of Indiana Sagamore of the Wabash Award, the 1996 Calumet College St. Joseph the Worker Award, and the 1997 Indiana University-Northwest Chancellor's Medallion Award Citation.", u"Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Lowery on his outstanding accomplishments during his 40 years of service to St. Timothy Community Church and its surrounding communities. His wife, Josephine Mathews-Lowery, and their daughters, Gay Marlene Lowery, Lynn Michele Lowery-Darby, and Jan Avis-Lowery, should be proud of his efforts, as his leadership has served as a beacon of hope throughout the Gary community. Dr. Lowery's devotion to improving the quality of life for the people of Indiana's First Congressional District is truly inspirational."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/09/24/E1839-3_congratulations-to-the-reverend-dr-robert-lowery/'}
