How can I describe what these two men meant to their beloved home State? These words of then President-elect John Fitzgerald Kennedy provide a start: ``And when, at some future date, the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us, recording whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state, our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be measured by the answers to four questions: first, were we truly men of courage; second, were we truly men of judgment; third, were we truly men of integrity; and finally, were we truly men of dedication?''", "These words, first uttered by President-elect Kennedy when I was an elementary school student in Caribou, began to have real meaning for me when they were quoted regularly in speeches by my old boss and mentor, Bill Cohen, a gifted orator and, in many ways, a walking Bartlett's.", "But the full impact of Kennedy's glorious phrases struck me with special poignancy this year as I pondered the loss of two of Maine's leading citizens, two good friends, two wonderful men who were taken from us while still in their early 60's, at the height of their powers.", "One was born in St. John Plantation in far northern Maine, the other in Auburn. One moved when he was one year old, the other after college. But each became synonymous with his community, Buzz Fitzgerald with Bath, and Joe Abromson with Portland.", "Each contributed mightily to his company, to his community, to his State. Each had a family that extended well beyond actual relatives to Mainers in all walks of life. Each made the lives of thousands of people better, and each did it without apparent effort and without a hint of self-righteousness.", "It is often said that if you want a job done well, find a busy man. Each of these remarkable individuals ran a company, each possessed a breathtaking list of civic and charitable credentials, and each demonstrated a willingness to embrace causes that would send many businessmen fleeing for cover.", "As I watch Buzz become a champion of reproductive rights for women, or Joel become a leading advocate for equal rights for gays and lesbians, I watched the embodiment of Kennedy's four defining characteristics: courage, judgment, integrity, dedication. Those four qualities were an immense aid to Joel as he championed a state law that would outlaw discrimination against Maine citizens who are gay or lesbian. Even though he did not prevail, he led his noble fight for gay rights with courage and integrity, in a manner that is to be commended. Indeed, I saw two men who could immerse themselves in the most emotional of issues, those causes that rubbed nerves raw in public debate, and I could see them emerge without enemies. Disagreeing without being disagreeable is a high art form, and these two men created a portrait of what informed public discourse should be.", "Buzz and Joel took their jobs and their commitments seriously, but never themselves. A rich store of humor, often self-deprecating, was never far from their lips. Successful people rarely lack charm, and each possessed it in abundance. Whether it was the union leadership hammering out a contract agreement with Buzz at the Bath Iron Works or Joel's colleagues on both sides of the aisle negotiating with him on a bill in the Maine Senate, friends and adversaries alike were drawn to both men because they invariably deserved to be trusted. It may be hackneyed to say their word was their bond. But it was. Always.", "A friend of mine who knew both men, but was not an intimate of either, tells a story that is illustrative. When my friend's father died in Florida, the first contribution made in his memory came from Joel Abromson. And when Buzzy's sister, Gayle Corey, died of a virulent form of cancer, Buzz did not wait to receive expressions of condolence; rather, he sent notes to Gayle's friends thanking them for befriending her. One does not easily forget gestures such as these, and there were thousands of others. In the final days and weeks of his life, Buzz called other cancer patients trying to cheer them up.", "Fortunately for all of us who benefited from knowing them, many Maine leaders, led by Governor King, participated in exceptionally moving public tributes to these two remarkable individuals while they were still alive to hear the accolades. Having spoken to both of them shortly before they died, I know that they were touched by the outpouring of appreciation for lives well lived.", "Losing public treasures like Joel and Buzz when they had so much more to give reminds us anew that life is unfair, as President Kennedy often noted. Fair or not, our state has lost two remarkable citizens and we will not see their like again soon.", "To me, they are the standard by which we should measure ourselves. Each of us will honor their memory most appropriately if we try to emulate the service they gave so generously to our State and its people. ", "Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/03/22/S2323-3_in-memoriam-of-buzz-fitzgerald-and-joel-abromson/"}
