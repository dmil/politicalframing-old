It is important for our military, it is important for our values, it is important for human rights, it is important for our country.", u"As we know, for nearly 17 years Federal law has dictated that gay and lesbian Americans serving or hoping to serve in our Nation's military must be silent about their sexual orientation. If that silence were broken, they would face the grim consequences of an almost certain discharge.", u"The don't ask, don't tell policy, as it has become commonly known, is inconsistent with our American values. It has robbed the military of valuable personnel who can contribute to military readiness and fulfillment of missions at home and abroad. That is why I opposed this policy in the mid-1990s and have advocated for its repeal ever since.", u"Throughout this debate I have heard from many Ohioans, including members of our military, expressing profound opposition to the policy of don't ask, don't tell. Ohioans such as Cadet Katherine Miller, LTC Victor Fehrenback, who spoke with me at one of my Thursday morning coffees in the Capitol, MAJ Mike Almy, and many other advocates and servicemembers have worked in their communities. They have walked the Halls of Congress to explain why don't ask, don't tell should be overturned.", u'Their experiences and that of those they represent are reminders that important battles remain in the fight for human rights and justice in our country. But we know for sure that history is on their side.', u"Today's vote will affirm what military leaders from Defense Secretary Gates to GEN Colin Powell to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen have been saying for some time: Repeal of don't ask, don't tell will make our military stronger. With our Nation at war, it is especially important that our policies promote the recruitment and retention of the very best soldiers, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender.", u'President Obama and Secretary Gates have conducted a year-long review--which many people in this Chamber in both parties, especially my Republican colleagues, asked for--on the impact of fully and openly integrating lesbian and gay Americans into the military. It is no surprise that the report concluded that open service poses no threat to our military readiness or effectiveness.', u"It is estimated that the don't ask, don't tell policy has cost the American people somewhere between $300 and $500 million to implement. It has resulted in the discharge of almost 14,000 soldiers--14,000 soldiers who were discharged not for performance but because of their sexual orientation. These 14,000 Americans include hundreds of Ohioans who offered to lay down their lives for this country. They deserve better than investigations and discharge. They deserve acceptance, affirmation and, most importantly, the right to serve openly and honestly in America's military.", u"The strength of our Nation is measured not just by the size of the economy or the might of our military, it is measured by acts consistent with our values, the very values our servicemembers defend and that define our Nation's greatness.", u"The repeal of don't ask, don't tell is a long overdue victory for our military, a victory for American values, a victory for human rights and, most important, a victory for the American people. I ask support of the measure, a resounding vote out of this Senate to go along with the House so the President can sign this bill and end this policy that has not served the American people well for much of two decades.", u'I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous consent that time under the quorum be charged equally to both sides.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/S10668-2_sbirsttr-reauthorization-act-of-1999-continued/'}
