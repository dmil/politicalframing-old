Police Chief Jared Stout announced yesterday that they had a prime suspect who was in custody. The Friendswood police were able to name this suspect after his arrest for kidnapping a 19-year-old woman from a nearby community called Webster.', u'In the case for which this suspect was arrested, he approached a young woman changing a flat tire and offered assistance, but as he approached, he pulled a knife on her and ordered her into his truck. This woman escaped by throwing herself out of his truck, which was moving down an interstate highway at 70 miles an hour sustaining significant injuries.', u'That was not the first time this individual had attacked a woman. The prime suspect in the murder of Laura Smither had been sentenced on December 18, 1986, to a total of 28 years for convictions on charges of aggravated kidnapping, forcible oral sodomy, and rape. He was released a year ago. He served less than half of that sentence, and now this man has been named as the prime suspect in the slaying of Laura Smither.', u'In less than a year, this individual, who had committed previous acts of kidnapping and violent sexual assault, has already been charged with aggravated kidnapping again. It is outrageous. Scientific data demonstrates that individuals who commit sex crimes against children have the highest recidivism rate of any criminal. It is irresponsible, if not downright negligent to release this individual back into society after serving only 10 years of a 28-year sentence for aggravated kidnapping, forcible oral sodomy and rape.', u"Violence against women and children cannot be tolerated. It cannot be excused. It cannot be swept under the rug. Rape and sexual violence are not minor offenses. They are violent attacks that violate the body and violate the human spirit. These crimes must be punished swiftly and severely. An Oklahoma court tried to do that when it sentenced this man to 28 years in prison. But somehow in that State's criminal justice system someone decided that 10 years was enough for that rapist. And less than a year later, one 19-year-old woman had to throw herself out of a truck to save herself, traveling 70 miles an hour down a highway sustaining significant injuries, to save herself from a rapist. And when Chief Stout's investigation is completed, we are likely to learn that this individual has committed a total of three acts of aggravated kidnapping, one act of forcible oral sodomy and two rapes and a murder.", u'We cannot lose these people in this system. Yes, this man was registered as a sex offender, but if he had been an incarcerated sex offender as he was sentenced, we might have a 12-year-old child alive today.', u"As for Bob and Gay Smither, they may soon know for certain who took their little girl away never to return again. That is little solace, but that is what the Friendswood Police Department has worked so hard to accomplish since we discovered Laura's body on April 20. We thank and salute them and the Webster Police Department, as well. And today we still pray, as many did last night gathered in Stevenson Park in Texas. We are all still mourning, and worst of all, we must continue to pray for the safe return of Jessica Cain, who has kidnapped from the same vicinity on August 17.", u'It was the way the community came together to search for Laura that spurred me to form the Congressional Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children. I am proud of the fact that 80 of our colleagues in the House have joined the effort to protect our children and reunite families. But this morning, Madam Speaker, I am frustrated and angry. Whatever we do here in Congress will not matter a bit if we do not punish these sexual predators and make them serve their full sentences in prison. Madam Speaker, we cannot allow more of these tragedies.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/10/21/H8838_sexual-predators/'}
