Just four months shy of his 70th birthday, Garlits broke the 300 mph speed barrier reaffirming his stature as the No. 1 driver in National Hot Rod Association history. He is a true testament to the indomitable American spirit, and with that said Mr. Speaker, I submit to the Congressional Record the highlights of ``Big Daddy'' Don Garlits' career as excerpted from the Daily Sun newspaper of November 12, 2001.", u"After a successful career, most men who turn 69 usually take life a little easier, enjoying an occasional afternoon nap, a leisurely round of golf and maybe a cold beer on the lanai. But then most men wouldn't dream of strapping into an 8,000 horsepower missile and catapulting themselves down a narrow, quarter-mile strip of asphalt in less than five seconds. That's because most men are not racers, because racers really never retire. They just wait for the next opportunity to race. Just ask ``Big Daddy'' Don Garlits. Garlits, a native of Tampa who now resides in Marion County, is the undisputed king of drag racing. He's won 144 national races, 17 world championships and every major honor that exists in the sport. And he's not finished. In his backyard garage, Don built ``Swamp Rat One,'' the first in a series of 34 all black rail style racecars. ``Swamp Rat One remains today as my favorite race car of all time. It had 750 horsepower and cost me $1000 to build,'' Garlits said. He started racing the car in 1956 and a year later set his first world's record, pushing the car to a top speed of 176.40 mph in 8.79 seconds. In 1958, man and machine won their first national championship. In 1963, Garlits drove the second generation Swamp Rat to a win at the NHRA Winternationals in Pomona, California. This victory established Big Daddy as a major player in professional drag racing. With wife Pat and daughters Gay Lyn and Donna by his side, Garlits dominated the sport for nearly three decades, developing innovative technology, setting speed records and enduring several major crashes. In the early 1970's, Garlits once again made history. It wasn't another speed record, but rather the design of Swamp Rat 14, the world's first successful rear engined dragster. ``I think that's my legacy, I really do,'' Garlits explained. ``I had so much opposition, everybody was against it. I took the car to Long Beach and the promoter didn't want me to run it. He told me every rear-engined car that ever went down his track crashed and he didn't want Don Garlits getting killed at his race track.'' The car went on to carry Big Daddy to another major championship and the rear-engine concept became the standard of the Top Fuel category. Garlits achieved another of his personal goals in 1984, when he and his family opened the Museum of Drag Racing adjacent to his Marion County home. The sprawling complex on County Road 484 has grown to include an impressive display of nearly 17 race cars in addition to a collection of 70 classic and antique cars. The complex also includes a race garage where Garlits is painstakingly building the newest and fastest Swamp Rat. He will race in next February at the NHRA Winternationals in Pomona, the site of his first major win. ``At the moment of launch, the motor will deliver 8,000 horsepower--roughly a thousand horsepower per cylinder,'' Garlits explained. ``It's really amazing, considering Swamp Rat One needed all eight cylinders to produce 750 horsepower.'' He expects the new state-of-the-art top fuel dragster to reach speeds in excess of 330 miles per hour in about four and a half seconds. Despite the high speeds, Garlits feels this Swamp Rat is the safest ever built. ``The first few generations of cars were just big motors, seats and fuel tanks strapped onto a couple of chassis rails. They didn't have near the safety technology used in today's cars,'' he explained. Garlits believes new technology will continue to move forward and future race cars will be much faster and much safer than the current models. ``We are being limited by new rules, not by technology and I agree with that,'' he said. ``Most current drag strips are too short and too narrow to accommodate the kind of speeds that technology is capable of producing. We're just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is technologically possible.'' Like a scene out of one of the Back to the Future movies, a slight smile crossed Big Daddy's face as he talked about the future. Because he intends to be a part of it. That's how racers think."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/11/16/E2112-3_recognizing-big-daddy-don-garlits/'}
