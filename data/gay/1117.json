No one could have foreseen an impact which, from a public health perspective, has resulted in the single worst public health crisis since the bubonic plague ravaged Europe more than 600 years ago.', u'That event occurring 20 years ago today was the publication of a brief description of the first five cases of a disease that could not be explained. The five people mentioned happened to have been infected with a virus that had never previously been described, and which at the time had no name. The five people had been infected with what was later called the HIV virus, and they died of complications associated with AIDS.', u'It was a case study. It was published by the CDC. At the time I was a third year surgical resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. I remember very vaguely 20 years ago those first case reports being talked about. And it was vague. It was obscure. Nobody had any idea because that virus had never been described in the history of mankind. Nobody had ever before talked about a virus with such power to destroy--to destroy cells, to destroy cellular function, to destroy life itself: the HIV/AIDS virus.', u"During my surgical residency, I was involved in operating every day. At the time, we had no earthly idea that this virus would infect much of our blood supply. No one knew that it would ultimately be transformed, 5 or 6 years later, into what became known as ``universal precautions,'' where, for the first time, we began to treat all blood in the operating room as potentially infected or potentially toxic. We started to wear double gloves. We started to wear a mask when we operated. We took these precautions to protect ourselves--not our patients This all occurred within a few years after these initial five cases were described. It changed the practice of medicine.", u'I had the opportunity earlier today to meet a wonderful person, a person whom I had previously only heard about. Her name is Denise Stokes. She has a wonderful voice and a wonderful story. The story was told to me and many others today.', u'Denise was infected with the HIV virus at the age of 13. Shortly after her infection was identified, she became active in the struggle against the virus. She described her many experiences in an intensive care unit. She described what it was like not to have access to available drugs. She talked about watching, in the depth of her illness, as policymakers talked about AIDS on television. She wondered whether at any point they would be able to respond to what has become the largest, most significant public health challenge in our lifetimes, in the last century--perhaps in the history of the world.', u'She talked about saying a silent prayer that hopefully there would be a cure someday. She talked about her hopes that someday she, by sharing her experiences, could become a catalyst for ultimately discovering a cure for HIV/AIDS.', u'Denise helped to put a face on heterosexual HIV infection in the 1980s. She was instrumental in gaining access to African-American churches in the early 1990s. As I said, she was infected when she was 13 years old. She is now 31. She talks to college students, community groups, and professional organizations sharing her story, a story that is powerful, a story that puts a face on HIV/AIDS.', u'No one 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, would have ever guessed that this disease would become the single worst public health crisis in over 700 years.', u"People ask: What do we think about this virus now 20 years later? The Kaiser Family Foundation, in a very recent survey, showed two things about Americans' thinking: No. 1, they see AIDS is the most urgent international health issue; and, No. 2, after cancer, Americans view HIV/AIDS is the most urgent health issue here at home.", u'And the American public is right on target. We have learned a great deal about this disease over the last 20 years. We know how to prevent it. We have fairly effective drugs and treatment therapies today for treating HIV and AIDS-related infections. They work in most cases if they are available and if they are taken properly.', u'Over the last 20 years--remember, this virus was not around 21 years ago--AIDS has become a very effective killer. About 8,000 people will die somewhere in the world today from this virus, this single little virus that 21 years ago, to the best of our knowledge, had killed no one.', u'Its impact has been tremendous. Consider the research field--speaking as a physician and medical scientist, I can say that in 1981 we had no drugs to treat this virus. About 6 years later, we had six or seven drugs. Now, we have about 65 drugs to treat this virus. In spite of that, as I said, it is killing about 8,000 people a day.', u'One thing that gives us some hope is the great boldness, the genius of our research industry--both the public sector through NIH and the private sector through the pharmaceutical companies --where there are today over 100 drugs in the pipeline to combat HIV/AIDS.', u"Our successes have been many. We have reduced the incidence of mother-to-child transmission thanks to counseling, voluntary testing, and AZT for pregnant women. New HIV infections have declined sharply. The Ryan White CARE Act, which originated in the Congress, supports care for over 100,000 people who otherwise would not be able to afford therapy. The drugs have doubled their life expectancies. That's a tremendous success. It has cut in half the average length of stay for HIV-related hospitalizations.", u'This body, I am proud to say, has responded to the changing face of HIV/AIDS, in the communities where it appears. For example, last year Congress expanded the reach of the Ryan White CARE Act to include a wider range of communities. We created supplemental grants for emerging metropolitan communities that previously had not been affected and in the past did not qualify for such funding.', u'The expansion in the program will benefit such places as Nashville, TN, where the Comprehensive Care Center, led by Dr. Steve Raffanti, has served more than 3,000 patients over the last 6 years, and is currently following almost 1,900 patients, 40 percent of whom fall below the poverty level.', u'How? The Congress first authorized the Ryan White CARE Act ten years ago and we reauthorized it five years ago and then again last year.', u'Congress has also responded with increased funding. Ryan White funding is now at a level of $1.8 billion a year. That is not double what it was when we started, or tripled, or quadrupled. It is 7 times what we initially put into the funding of the Ryan White Care Act.', u'But there is so much more to be done. There are 500,000 to 600,000 Americans living with the HIV infection and another 320,000 people with AIDS. We have reduced the number of new infections from 150,000 a year down to 40,000 a year. That is tremendous progress, but it is not acceptable. 40,000 new infections per year is one new infection every 13 minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.', u'Our loved ones are at risk. Even worse, there are some new danger signs on the horizon. The progress and the advances that have been made appear to have created an element of complacency. Surveys indicate today that 80 percent of our young people do not believe they are at risk for HIV infection. Such ignorance and complacency breeds incaution, less prevention, and, ultimately, more infections.', u'Last week, the CDC featured a report which cited a frightening increase in HIV incidence for young African-American gay and bisexual males. In Tennessee, the number of HIV/AIDS infections increased by a startling 35 percent over the 2-year period of 1998 to the year 2000. We simply cannot allow this increase in the number of infections. We cannot allow a new wave of infections in our country. All of this is a call to arms, a call to arms for all of us as citizens of our communities, as Americans, and as citizens of the world.', u'As we were talking this morning, Denise talked about initially withdrawing within herself as the virus infected her at age thirteen. As she grew older, she started to reach out--first, to her community; later, to policy makers.', u'Denise should be an example for all of us. We have a moral obligation to reach out within our communities and beyond, to the United States of America and beyond. We need to reach out to the entire world. Indeed, as troubling as the trends are in this country, they pale beside the staggering disaster of HIV/AIDS in the developing world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.', u'The historical enemies of human beings--and we all know what they are: war, famine, natural disasters, persecution--today are dwarfed by the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The crisis is one of public health. The crisis is one of developmental economies. The crisis is one of humanitarian outreach.', u'The global statistics of HIV/AIDS are chilling. I just mentioned that an American is infected with HIV/AIDS every 13 minutes. During that same 13 minutes, 72 people will die of HIV/AIDS somewhere in the world. Twice that number will become newly infected. I have had the opportunity to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee. In that committee, I chair the Africa subcommittee. I have had the opportunity to travel to Uganda, to Kenya, to the Congo, to the Sudan. I have had the opportunity to perform surgery in hospitals in the last several years where HIV infections among patients run as high as 50 percent. When you travel to Africa, just as Secretary Powell did 2 weeks ago, you see that Africa is losing an entire generation. It is that middle generation that is being wiped out. It is that working generation that is being wiped out. It is the parenting generation that is being wiped out.', u'How many orphans result? How many devastated families? How many impoverished villages? How many ruined economies?', u'The good news is we know a lot about how to reverse the epidemic through a combination of political commitment--I am speaking to my colleagues and to the political leadership of others around the world--of donor support--again, I am speaking to those both inside and outside government who are in a position to contribute--and of newly committed leadership in countries being devastated by the disease. Those three elements, in places such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand, have had remarkable successes.', u'On the ground in these countries, work by community-based organizations, both religious and secular, has been the linchpin of success.', u"It is very important that we not separate prevention from care and treatment. Science has not yet found a cure. There is no vaccine for HIV/AIDS. Not yet. It will be 5 years, or 7 years, or 10 years maybe more. I am not sure if it will even be a vaccine. It may be a highly effective treatment. One of the many problems of this virus is, once it gets into the memory system of the cells of the human body, those cells stay there for decades, 60 and 70 years. That's just one of the challenges for our research community.", u'Recent action by the pharmaceutical companies to slash prices on antiretrovirals for poor countries has done two things. First, it sends the message of hope. Second, it puts a spotlight on the necessity of establishing an infrastructure of health care to be able to engage in prevention and care and treatment.', u'Access to treatment and drugs for opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis is also critical. For all the damage that HIV/AIDS does, tuberculosis kills more people in Africa with AIDS than any other opportunistic infection.', u'Creation and ongoing support of public health infrastructure, of health care delivery systems, including personnel training, is essential to effective treatment and education programs.', u'What more should we do to address this challenge?', u"The reason I am discussing this tonight is that 21 years ago, before the first case studies, we had no idea of the catastrophe of this pandemic which now travels across the world. I have spoken a lot about Africa in the last few minutes; and there is increasing public awareness of the magnitude of the disaster there. When I ask which single country in the world has more HIV/AIDS cases than any other, most of my colleagues and those listening would guess a country in Africa. That's wrong. It is believed that India now has more cases than any other country.", u"If I ask what country in the world has the fastest growth rate in HIV/AIDS, again, most would guess an African country. That's also probably wrong. We think it's Russia. Frankly, we're not sure because public health information is so poor in most of these places.", u"There is no debate that no region of the world is more affected than Africa. But guess which region is second; it's the Caribbean.", u'This is truly a global challenge. The price tag for an effective response is staggering. Billions of dollars are going to be required. The United Nations estimates that $3 to $5 billion will be required in Africa alone. $3 to $5 billion to develop an appropriate human and physical infrastructure to address this challenge. Governments must respond. Legislatures like ours, the executive branch, and the governments of the world are the only ones able to commit the resources needed.', u'New public-private partnerships that draw on our creativity must be developed to implement the strategies that are put forward.', u'The United States has taken real leadership on this issue. Although we often are criticized by other nations, we need to make it clear that the United States right now is contributing about half the funds that the entire world is currently spending internationally to fight the problem.', u'We spend more than anyone on research and on education. We spend more than anyone on treatment of HIV/AIDS. We spend more than anyone to help the rest of the world deal with this problem. Indeed, U.S. foundations alone have contributed more money to attack this problem than most other governments.', u'This does not mean that we are the only ones doing our part. Other nations, the United Nations, the World Bank, corporations, and philanthropies have been joining together, particularly over the past year.', u'President George W. Bush, just 3 or 4 weeks ago, took a real leadership position, committing $200 million, the first country to do so, to a global fund to combat AIDS.', u'Secretary of State Colin Powell, on his recent return from Africa, said:', u'There is no war that is causing more death and destruction . . . that is more serious . . . than the war in sub-Saharan Africa against HIV/AIDS.', u'I will close with seven steps we can take to engage this war:', u'No. 1. United leadership. We should ask the political, religious, and business leaders of the world to unite in joining the international commitment to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and to help those afflicted with the disease. They should commit both financial and human resources to the fight.', u"No. 2. A global fund. I mentioned and commended President Bush's commitment to this global international fund for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. This should not be an American fund. It should not even be a United Nations fund. It should be a global fund that represents a new way of doing business--transparent and responsive. Traditional donors such as European countries, Japan, and others, as well as the business community, foundations, and other institutions of civil society should all be participants in this fund.", u'In the very near future, I intend to offer legislation authorizing U.S. contributions to this new global fund, this new way of doing business.', u'No. 3. Swift funding. We should put nongovernmental and community-based organizations, both religious and secular, at the forefront of the action on the ground by getting funds to them quickly so they can most effectively do their jobs reaching out. We know they have an enormous impact, and speed saves lives.', u'No. 4. Partnerships. We should encourage and empower coalitions and partnerships of governments, universities, academies, research institutions, multilateral institutions, corporations, and the nongovernmental organizations to come together as partners, as coalitions, to help fill the gap between the available resources and the unmet needs of prevention, care, and treatment. Each member of the partnership brings a unique contribution to the battle.', u'No. 5. Research. We should make absolutely certain that international research efforts on disease affecting poor countries--and that includes AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis--are reinforced in a manner that assures the best scientific research in the world can lead to real benefits for the developing world at a cost they can afford.', u'We should continue to aggressively support and encourage research into vaccines and treatments in both private and public institutions like the National Institutes of Health. The Senate has recently supported the doubling of funding at the NIH over 5 years. We should also give new financial incentives for private research. The pharmaceutical companies are doing tremendous research in the field of HIV/AIDS, but more is needed.', u'There are numerous vaccines currently under investigation. Their success will be measured in millions of lives saved. Just think of it.', u'No. 6. Prevention, care, and treatment. I already mentioned that prevention needs to be tied to care and treatment. I am very excited about new low-cost options which can link care and treatment with prevention over time. No. 7. And I will close with this--is hope. As I talked with Denise Stokes today, I was struck by her remarkable enthusiasm, her optimism, and her commitment to teaching others about this disease which changed her life from the age of 13.', u"The most remarkable thing to me, as I listened to her and learned that she was just in the emergency room 2 days ago, was the simple fact that here she was talking to a large crowd of people with her story. She was sharing what was inside, reaching out broadly to people from all over the world, bringing her special message which can be summed up in one word: ``hope.''", u'We should do all we can to provide comfort and care to families all over the world today. We should address the issue of the orphans created by this terribly destructive disease. We have a moral responsibility to give them hope.', u'Yes, the challenge is before us--a moral challenge, a humanitarian challenge. There has never before been such a challenge in terms of sheer magnitude.', u'As Americans, it is natural to reach out to those around us, domestically, to give a helping hand. Now we must join with other nations to extend our helping hand further to create a better world, a safer world, and a more fulfilling world. We do that here at home with boldness, genius, and creativity, along with a healthy dose of courage, persistence, and patience. Let us now rise to the global challenge as a compassionate people in a great and compassionate nation.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/06/05/S5821-2_the-hivaids-virus/'}
