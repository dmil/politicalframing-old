Founded in 1974 as Women Against Rape, the agency consisted of a phone number to call for emotional support. Today that crisis line operates 24 hours a day, and the organization has 12 board members, 14 paid staff, and more than 40 volunteers who address the problems related to all forms of sexual assault.", "Over the past 30 years, UASA as greatly expanded the services offered to the people of Sonoma County. It provides extensive training on helping victims, including not only women and girls, but also men, children, and the families of victims. Staff and volunteers also accompany victims and their families for police reporting, court appearances, medical exams, or other personal situations.", "Prevention programs include outreach to elementary through high school youths, reaching approximately 6,000 young people every year, as well as parents and school personnel. Other efforts include bilingual outreach to Hispanic teens, teen peer education training, anti-racism curriculum which deals with violence against the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender community, and a unique men's program featuring men educating men. All services are offered at no cost.", "UASA also plays a key role in the county's pioneering SART (sexual assault response team) which unites law enforcement, mental health, legal, and advocacy programs to support victims and families. This collaborative project makes services easily accessible and minimizes the stress felt by victims. The agency is also working with the District Attorney's office to establish a county-wide Family Justice Center by 2005.", "In May 2004, Executive Director Gloria Young was named ``Outstanding Director of the Year'' by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault for shepherding the agency through many of these transitions.", "Mr. Speaker, UASA's long-term mission is to eliminate all forms of sexual assault. I know that with its inspired leadership, dedicated staff, and committed volunteers United Against Sexual Assault of Sonoma County has brought our community a long way toward achieving this goal and will not be satisfied until they have reached it. I salute UASA on their 30th anniversary and look forward to the day when their services are no longer needed."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2004/09/15/E1626-4_30th-anniversary-of-united-against-sexual-assault-/"}
