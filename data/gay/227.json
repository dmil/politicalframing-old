This legislation makes a profound statement that this country will not tolerate bigotry and ignorance that results in violence against its citizens.", "My first vote as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives was for equal rights on housing and employment for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans-gendered (GLBT) community. As a Member of Congress, including this important vote today, I will have proudly voted for this legislation three times. It is time for this bill to become law so that all Americans can fully participate in and enjoy the rights of a democratic society.", "Since 1991 the FBI has received more 113,000 reports of hate crimes and we know that this crime is underreported. The message of this bill is clear. The country does not tolerate crimes committed against individuals based on their sexual orientation. Crimes of hate are unlike other violent acts of randomness. Targeting people because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender or disability is a form of domestic terrorism that sends chilling messages to communities that they are not welcome and that intolerance and ignorance is alive and well.", "Some have inaccurately suggested that this bill legislates against thoughts and ideas. That is absolutely untrue. The focus of this bill is to provide local authorities a greater means by which to prosecute violent acts of hate, not thoughts. Not only does this bill not legislate against thoughts and speech, it explicitly includes First Amendment free speech protections for persons accused of acts of hate.", "Current law limits federal jurisdiction over hate crimes to violent acts committed against citizens based on religion, race, color and national origin if they are targeted while they are participating in federally protected activities, such as voting. H.R. 254 will strengthen federal law by expanding federal jurisdiction and allocate the necessary resources and tools to local law enforcement officials and prosecutors to go after individuals who act on their bigotry and ignorance with violence. The needed prosecution of hate crimes can stretch crucial state and local resources thin. This legislation authorizes the Attorney General to make grants available to law enforcement agencies that have acquired astounding expenses investigating and prosecuting hate crime cases.", "This bill is needed to protect the civil rights of all Americans who have been targeted based on their differences and it utilizes the resources of this government to ensure fairness and justice. I commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, for bringing this legislation to the Floor and I urge my colleagues to support it."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/05/14/E1036-2_support-for-hr-254/"}
