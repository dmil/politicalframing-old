As men, Mr. Speaker, we play many roles in society, such as husbands, fathers, brothers, bread winners, Congressmen, Presidents, and more importantly co-partners in families and in some instances heads of families. None of the roles mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Rather, they are all part of an integrated whole.', u"Some of us are very comfortable in each role. Others may find it difficult handling the presence and pressures associated with so many roles. Therefore, as we deal with National Men's Health Week, which is designed to promote health among men and to address a broad range of issues regardless of roles or status, let us be mindful that this is not an egotistical approach to elicit gender competition, but it is simply a reminder that we should all pay attention to problems that are gender specific.", u'If we are not healthy, we cannot be the best husbands, fathers, or productive citizens that are vital to help keep our society going. Today, men suffer from some alarming health statistics. It is common knowledge that heart disease is the leading cause of death among men in the United States.', u'The life expectancy of men is much lower than that of women by at least 7 years. Currently men represent 84 percent of all AIDS cases in the United States. In the African-American community, HIV/AIDS is spreading like wildfire. A recent survey revealed an increased infection rate of 4.4 percent for young gay men. The rates ranged from 2.5 percent all the way up to 14.7 percent among gay black men. In Chicago alone, gay men account for 53 percent of HIV/AIDS cases. Public health officials say that they are seeing disturbing trends of reckless behavior.', u'Another sad statistic is the mortality rate for African Americans from all types of cancer. It is 68 percent higher than for any other group. There are many other types of ailments that afflict us, such as high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, excessive accidents on the road.', u'Well, as one can see very well, the problems are there. The odds seem to be against men. But I assure my colleagues that an ounce of prevention is worth much more than 1,000 remedies.', u'So I would urge all men not to wait until it is too late to bring into our lives the proper balance of health care. We can all have a better life. If that is not possible, we can all certainly make life more bearable.', u'I urge all men to take time to reflect on the value of your life, on the well-being of yourself, and the ripple effect that it can have on all of the roles that you play and the lives of all the people with whom you come into contact. Should your health, your state of mind, your stress level or anything else be of concern that requires attention, please consult your physician, seek assistance at your earliest convenience.', u"Let us celebrate Father's Day in good health as we celebrate this week dedicated to improving the health, not only of all of our citizens, but especially the health of men who oftentimes do not look or pay as much attention to themselves.", u"I also take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to indicate support for the efforts and activities of individuals, organizations, institutions and other entities that are designed to honor fatherhood on Father's Day, especially when we look at statistics which suggest that children who are raised without their fathers account for 63 percent of youth suicides, 71 percent of pregnant teenagers, 90 percent of homeless and runaway children, 85 percent of behavior disorders.", u'As my colleagues can see, Mr. Speaker, all of these problems are seriously affecting not only the lives of individuals, but the lives of people in our country.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/06/12/H3032_national-mens-health-week/'}
