Last year over 3,000 people marched in the parade and participated as exhibitors, entertainers, or volunteers at the street fair. More than 175,000 people attended this annual celebration.", "It has been 35 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and gays and lesbians are still not covered by its protections. We must fight to make sure that not another 35 years or 10 years or even 1 year more passes without this Nation recognizing sexual orientation as a protected class in the United States. Congress must pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), and I will do my best to make sure that it is passed in this Congress.", "This year, the Capital Pride Festival organizers and sponsors, the Whiteman-Walker Clinic and One-in-Ten, have selected ``Unite, Celebrate, Remember'' for the Festival's theme. Let's take that theme to heart and unite to achieve our goal of eliminating discrimination based on sexual orientation, celebrate our accomplishments, and remember those, like Matthew Shepherd, who we have lost because hatred and discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered Americans still exist.", "Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in saluting the 24th Annual Capital Pride Festival, its organizers, and the volunteers who make it possible."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/02/24/E282-2_24th-annual-capital-pride-festival-june-5-13-1999/"}
