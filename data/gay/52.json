Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.', u'On the night of September 1, 2007, Josie Smith-Malave, her sister Julie Smith, and her friend Emily Durwood, were attacked outside a Long Island bar for being gay. The three women had been at the bar that night, and, as they left, they were followed outside by three women and about nine men. The group of about a dozen young adults began to crowd around the three women, shouting antigay slurs, throwing sticks and cups at them and spitting on them. The group then began to punch and kick the three women. One of the victims suffered a head injury, another suffered a knee injury, and all three were badly bruised as a result of the attack. The attackers fled the scene before police arrived, but one man was arrested 4 days later for his alleged involvement in the assault, which included stealing a camera from and injuring one of the women. He is charged with a hate-biased crime.', u"I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/09/17/S11574_matthew-shepard-act/'}
