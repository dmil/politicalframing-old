It was perhaps too much to hope for a dramatic breakthrough, but the status quo remains unacceptable.", "As we celebrate and commemorate Israeli Independence Day, it is more important than ever to remember why the United States has such a strong relationship with Israel.", "Fifty-four years ago, the creation of the state of Israel gave hope to Jews everywhere that safety, freedom, and justice could be found at last--in the ancient cradle of the Jewish faith and civilization. A half-century of friendship and cooperation between Israel and the United States began with President Truman's courageous recognition of Israel shortly after its establishment. Throughout many battles, our relationship has remained strong, and it continues today, with our common search for security and peace in the Middle East.", "Israel is now engaged in one of its most challenging wars ever, the war against terrorism. Since the latest Palestinian intifada began, more than 400 Israeli civilians have been killed by suicide bombers--over 125 since March. Hundreds more have been injured in these attacks--attacks that are designed to strike at the heart of Israel itself.", "The Palestinians have also suffered hundreds of casualties, and innocent civilians, including children, are being used as human shields by terrorists hiding in refugee camps.", "Peace is the only way to move forward, a peace that contemplates two states coexisting side-by-side. But Israel can only achieve peace from a position of strength. I have long been an advocate for a strong US-Israel security relationship. Now is not the time to back away from our security relationship or to give any credence to the misguided efforts of the European Union to impose economic sanctions against Israel.", "A critical contribution towards resolution of the current crisis must be taken by moderate Arab regimes--our allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia--to pressure the Palestinians to genuinely renounce terrorism. Chairman Arafat's recent statement deploring terrorist attacks--delivered in English to an American--served no more purpose than to bring Secretary Powell to Ramallah. Far more revealing was a recent statement from Mr. Arafat's wife--in Arabic to the Arabic press--saying that she would be proud to have a future son become a suicide bomber.", "It has unfortunately been shown time and time again that the parties in the region will be unable to achieve peace on their own. All past breakthroughs for peace have been the result of US and international leadership and every future breakthrough will require the same. I commend the Administration for resuming a leadership role in the Mideast, and I urge it to remain engaged with the parties and moderate Arab states in the region.", "Last week, in a ceremony commemorating Yom ha-Shoah, National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice made the connection between our remembrance of the Holocaust and our continued fight against evil in the war on terrorism. I would ask that her remarks be entered into the Record.", "May our memories of the horror of the Holocaust fuel our hunger for a permanent peace.", "Security Affairs, at the 2002 National Commemoration of the Days of ", "As Prepared Survivors, liberators, Members of Congress, Members of the Cabinet, Ambassador Ivry, other members of the diplomatic corps, Benjamin Meed, Fred Zeidman, Elie Wiesel, Ruth Mandel, other honored guests, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for inviting me to join you for Yom ha-Shoah. We gather today to remember that evil is real and present in our world. We gather to remember that hatred and bigotry are always and everywhere wrong. We gather to remember that the commission of monstrous sin requires not our consent, but only our indifference, our neutrality, or our silence. We gather to light six candles, so that we may never forget six million acts of murder. With each passing year, the number of living Holocaust survivors and liberators grows smaller. When all the eyewitnesses are gone, the Holocaust's history will be taught not from the searing pain of memory but from the pressing call of conscience. Last year, when the President spoke here, the Holocaust seemed somewhat removed from our era--part of a bloody century now behind us. Sadly, this year we need no prompting to appreciate the Holocaust's importance and its relevance. Fanatical, unreasoning hatred has intruded upon our lives in ways that no one could have imagined months ago. From the Holy Land, we see daily images of carnage, and from Europe, come images of synagogues and Torah scrolls burned. Our own land has seen the mass destruction of innocents, guilty of nothing more than going to work in a country called America on a beautiful, but terrible autumn morning. And the world was sent obscene videotapes where evil leaders celebrate the slaughter, and yet another tape where a man is killed after being made to say the words, ``I am a Jew.'' This year, evil has spoken to all of us, and on this day we need no reminder to answer back, but firmly: ``never again.'' As our world prevails through these difficult days, and as we pray for peace for all the children of Abraham, it is important to recall not just the Holocaust's horrors, but also its heroes: bearers of witness like Jan Karski; rescuers like Wallenberg and Schindler; writers like Anne Frank and Elie Wiesel; and resistors like the Danes and the righteous of many nations who hid and saved many thousands of their Jewish neighbors. And, of course, we recall those who fought from inside the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1943, and who, as Elie Wiesel wrote, lit a flame that ``continues to burn in our memory'' even through the distance of six decades, We draw strength from these names--all familiar to our lips--and we gain inspiration from their stories. Less often, we think of the other heroes, the countless ordinary Jews, Roma, Jehovah's Witnesses, gay people, and disabled men and women who defied the machinery of murder with quiet acts of courage and piety. Their names are mostly unknown to all but Him, yet their lives too instruct. I remember visiting Yad Vashem and seeing a photograph of a handsomely dressed Jewish couple in the Warsaw Ghetto. The guide at the museum said that people often express consternation at the photograph, wondering how odd it was that against the ghetto's backdrop of danger and desperation this couple had obviously gone to great lengths to ensure that their clothing and grooming were impeccable. I had a different reaction. I said immediately, ``I understand that photograph. These people are saying, `I'm still in control, I still have my dignity.' They are saying, `You can take everything from us, including life itself. But you cannot take away our pride.'' I've often wondered what became of that couple. I imagine that long after they were no longer able to control their appearance they still found subtle ways to say, ``You cannot control me, you cannot take away my pride and dignity.'' I've wondered whether they were part of the uprising; whether they perished in a camp; whether they were among the few who survived; whether they may even have had children like Marek Edelman or Bronislaw Geremek who survived and went on to become members of Solidarity and leaders in a free and democratic Poland. And I have thought about that couple from the ghetto even more in the days since September 11. Because right now, all of us are enduring a time of testing, loss, and fear; a time when our vulnerability to evil and the certainty of our mortality are all too clear; a time when once again our intellect is insufficient to answer the question, ``Why?'' And at these times more than ever, we are reminded that it is a privilege to struggle for good against evil. We do not choose our circumstances or trials, but we do choose how we respond to them. Too often when all is well, we slip into the false joy and satisfaction of the material and a complacent pride and faith in ourselves. Yet it is through struggle that we find redemption and self-knowledge. This is what the slaves of Exodus learned. And it is what slaves in America meant when they sang: ``Nobody knows the trouble I've seen, Glory Hallelujah!'' None of our current travails approach those of the Holocaust. The evil of the Holocaust is singular. Yet its lessons are universal. So today, we remember that ignorance and cruelty are never far away, and that their atrocities demand action and justice. We remember that every life has value and all lives are ennobled by opposing hate and bigotry. We remember that not even mankind's worst depravities can be allowed to dissuade us from our search for worldly and spiritual peace. In this nation of immigrants, surrounded here by the symbols and totems of tolerance and freedom, we remember our very great responsibility to protect freedom and to welcome all of God's creatures into its loving embrace. And we remember the words of the Kaddish, ``Oseh shalom beem'roh'mahv, hoo ya'aseh shalom, aleynu v'al kohl yisrae'el v'eemru: Amein.''"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/04/17/E563-3_statement-of-congresswoman-jane-harman-on-israeli-/"}
