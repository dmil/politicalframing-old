I commend Senator Kennedy for his leadership in this effort and on this bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. This legislation amends the federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability.', u'Violent crime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of us. It is not a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the American conscience. Just this month, an adherent of a white supremacist group killed two people and wounded nine others in a shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana that was apparently motivated by racial and religious hate. Billy Jack Gaither, 39, was beaten to death in Alabama because he was gay. Matthew Sheppard, 21, was left to die on a fence in Wyoming because he was gay. James Byrd, Jr., 49, a father of three, was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Texas because he was black. These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus public attention. But there also is a toll we are paying each year in other hate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for the victims and their families.', u'It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence.', u'All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. This continues that great and honorable tradition.', u'Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law enforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives that assist law enforcement. It is in this vein as well that I support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country.', u"The bill has been materially improved since its introduction on March 16th. At that time, I questioned whether the bill was sufficiently respectful of state and local law enforcement interests and cautioned against federalizing prohibitions that may already exist at the state and local level. The Senate-passed bill includes a new certification requirement, which provides that the Federal government may only step in where the State has not assumed jurisdiction, the State has requested that the federal government assume jurisdiction, or the State's actions are likely to leave unvindicated the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence. I am satisfied that this provision will ensure that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as intended, strengthening Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement.", u'The Hate Crimes Prevention Act gives us a formidable tool for combating acts of violence motivated by race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. I urge its speedy passage into law.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/07/26/S9212-3_the-hate-crimes-prevention-act-of-1999/'}
