The sacrificial service of these brave men and women committed to God, family, and country has preserved the freedom of this great Nation and granted freedom to millions around the world. Though, we must never forget that freedom is not free. The price of freedom is paid for with the lives and blood of the men and women of our Armed Forces.", u'Just 8 days ago on November 1, 2007, our Nation lost retired BG Paul W. Tibbetts when he died at the age of 92 surrounded by family and friends in Columbus, OH. At a time when our Nation witnessed the rape of Nanking, the Death March to Bataan, and the tragedy of Pearl Harbor, General Tibbetts fulfilled his call to duty and today we honor him for his service.', u"February 23, 1915, was a significant day in history as it marked the birth of Paul Warfield Tibbetts, Jr. to Mr. Paul and Enola Gay Tibbetts. Just 30 years later their son would command the most famous single military air strike in world history over Hiroshima, Japan, in a plane carrying his mother's namesake.", u"In one of his very rare interviews, General Tibbetts, offered his perspective on his role in the bombing of Hiroshima. ``I'm not proud that I killed 80,000 people, but I'm proud I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did,'' he said years later. ``You've got to take stock and assess the situation at that time. We were at war, and you use anything at your disposal.''", u"This gives us great insight into the life and legacy of BG Paul W. Tibbetts, whose unwavering commitment epitomized the words of the 18th Century British philosopher John Stuart Mill, ``War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.''"], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/11/09/E2386-2_tribute-to-bg-paul-w-tibbets-jr/'}
