His intent, and I quote, ``sending a message by killing Jews.'' What kind of message was he sending? A message of hatred.", "One year ago yesterday, in Laramie, Wyoming, a young man named Matthew Shepard was killed. The reason? Because he was gay.", "In Jasper, Texas, a man was murdered and dragged through the streets because he was an African-American.", "All of these incidents are hate crimes. They do not just affect the group that was killed, they affect each and every one of us.", "This is especially troubling to me because of the rash of anti-immigrant billboards and posters in my district of late which falsely blame immigrants for all of society's problems. Having spent my entire life in Queens County in New York, I recognize the problems faced on a daily basis by minorities who strive to eliminate any form of discrimination still present in our society. Unfortunately, the billboards of late only tell that discrimination is alive and well.", "I believe the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 is a constructive and measured response to a problem that continues to plague our Nation. Violence motivated by prejudice. This legislation is also needed because many States lack comprehensive hate crime laws.", "I understand there are some people who believe that hate should not be an issue when prosecuting a crime. They say our laws already punish the criminal act and that our laws are strong enough as is. I answer with the most recent figures from 1997, when 8,049 hate crimes were reported in the United States, 8,049 crimes, because of hate. According to the FBI, hate crimes are underreported. So the actual figure is much, much higher.", "I say to my colleagues, penalties for committing a murder are increased if the murder happens during the commission of a crime. Murdering a police officer is considered first degree murder, even if there was no premeditation. Committing armed robbery carries a higher punishment than petty larceny. There are degrees to crimes. Local governments and State governments and the Federal Government recognize that. And committing a crime against someone because of their race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity or other group should warrant a different penalty. These crimes are designed to send a message, ``We don't like your kind and here is what we're going to do about it.'' So why can we not punish crimes motivated by hate differently than other crimes?", "Mr. Speaker, this legislation does not punish free speech as some have contended. Nowhere does it say you cannot hold a certain political belief or view or a particular philosophy. What it does say is that if you commit a violent act because of those beliefs, you will be punished and punished differently.", "Hate crime laws are also constitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Wisconsin v. Mitchell unanimously upheld a Wisconsin statute which gave enhanced sentences to a defendant who intentionally selects a victim because of the person's race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, sex or nation of origin.", "I believe we ought to stand up as a Congress and as a country to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act to make our laws tougher for the people who carry out these heinous crimes.", "The Senate has already included it as part of the fiscal year 2000 Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. I would urge the House conferees to recede to the Senate on this section. At the very least, H.R. 1082 should be brought to the House floor for consideration. We must end the hate that is permeating our society."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/10/13/H9963-2_in-support-of-hate-crimes-prevention-act/"}
