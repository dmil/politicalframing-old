This is a simple, straight-forward bill that would allow continued political outreach through prerecorded phone messages, but protect American families from being inundated by calls all through the day and night.", "In recent years, we have seen an unparalleled development of new technologies that help political candidates reach out to voters.", "This is a good thing. Political speech is essential, and should be protected. The vast majority of these technological developments bolster the Democratic process, promoting an interchange of information and ideas.", "One of these is the so-called robocall, in which a prerecorded message can be sent out to tens of thousands of voters at a minor cost through computer automation.", "With television and radio ads becoming so expensive, these prerecorded calls can play an important role alerting voters to a candidate's position and urging their support at the polls.", "A recent Pew Foundation poll found that 80 percent of Iowans in the recent primaries received automated political robocalls. A high level of sophistication goes into these robocalls--they are targeted and specific software dictates who is called, and when. ", "But the process can be abused. And we all have heard stories about people being called over and over and over again at all hours of the day and night.", "I believe this is wrong. Not only is it interfering with the privacy rights of Americans, but it can turn people away from the political process itself.", "Commercial calls are already limited by the Federal Trade Commission's ``Do Not Call'' list--with millions of individuals subscribing. But political calls were specifically exempted from that list.", "Let me be clear: I am not seeking to eliminate all robocalls. Instead, this legislation is carefully designed to provide some safeguards without halting the practice altogether.", "The Robocall Privacy Act of 2008 bans political robocalls to any person from 9 p.m. in the evening and a.m. in the morning.", "It also bans more than two political robocalls from each campaign to the same telephone number per day, bans the caller from blocking the ``caller identification'' number, and requires an announcement at the beginning of the call identifying the individual or organization making the call and the fact that it is a pre-recorded message. This is to prevent misinformation about the caller.", "The enforcement provisions of this bill are simple and intent on stopping the worst of these calls. The bill creates a civil fine for violators of the law, with additional fines for callers who willfully violate the law.", "The bill also allows voters to sue to stop those calls immediately, but not receive money damages. A judge can order violators of the law to stop these abusive calls.", "Why are these provisions so important? Let me briefly describe some recent incidents:", "Hundreds of robocalls woke voters up at 2 in the morning during a 2007 New York election--because of a software programming error. The calls were supposed to occur at 2 p.m.", "In the Nebraska 3rd District Congressional Election, voters complained to candidate Scott Kleeb when they received dozens of calls, containing poor-quality versions of his voice. Kleeb's supporters claim that his voice was recorded, and used in an abusive robocall against him.", "In the 2006 Congressional elections, many calls wrongly implied that one candidate was making a robocall. The message began with a recorded voice stating that the call contained information about U.S. Representative Melissa Bean. Some voters called Bean's office to complain without listening to the entire message, which eventually identified an opposing party committee as the sponsor--when most voters had hung up. Representative Bean had to spend campaign funds informing voters she had not made that call.", "The National Do Not Call Network--a nonprofit focused on this issue--has indicated voters receive many calls a day. They have reported as much as 37 political phone calls in one day for one voter. That same organization reports that 40 percent of its membership indicated it received between 5 and 9 calls a day during the election season.", "In a recent Texas campaign, a negative robocall was sent to voters early in the morning--supposedly from one of the candidates. That candidate immediately protested it was not done on his behalf--but instead was an attempt to smear him by using his name. Voters became furious at the call.", "In a Maryland race in November 2006, in a conservative area residents received a middle-of-the-night robocall from the nonexistent ``Gay and Lesbian Push,'' urging them to support one of the candidates. That candidate lost the election, and enraged voters about the false, late-night call.", "Repeated robocalls to Tennessee resident Jonathan Gregory caused him to complain to The Tennessean newspaper: ``It's extremely annoying, and it's like getting telemarketing calls at work. . . . I think they should have some type of limit on how many times they can call the same number.''", "A February 1 Letter to the Editor of the Harrisburg Patriot-News, from a woman from East Pennsboro, PA, indicated that she received many political robocalls to her personal cell phone and was billed for each call.", "I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment protection for political speech and I want to encourage the free exchange of information about candidates.", "But I also believe people should have a right to be protected from the most egregious forms of abuse.", "However, the worst of these calls are disturbing people in their homes by forcing them to answer calls and listen again and again. Something must be done.", "The bill does not ban robocalls. It merely provides a reasonable framework of tailored time, place, and manner restrictions.", "I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the Robocall Privacy Act of 2008."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/02/12/S920_statements-on-introduced-bills-and-joint-resolutio/"}
