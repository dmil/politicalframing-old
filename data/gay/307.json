Many of my colleagues argued that the assault and homicide statutes in the individual states were sufficient to address any abuses perpetrated against our citizens because of race, religion, ethnicity or sexual preference. Others argued that many states already had hate crimes laws on the books and therefore a Federal statute was simply an unnecessary duplication.", u"Unfortunately, our failure to act signals much more than a concern about duplication of laws or an honest debate about the sufficiency of state laws to protect innocent citizens against crimes which occur simply because the victims are in some way ``different'' from their attackers. These physical attacks have increased with alarming frequency; they have been both racially motivated and homophobic. During the 105th Congress, we saw violent racial attacks on Black men and children which resulted in severe injuries in two cases and death in another. The recent death of Wyoming student, Matthew Shepard, was due solely to the fact that he was gay and his attackers hated gays. Bias and prejudice are not figments of a liberal imagination; they are very real acts especially when they result in death or injury.", u'Unless we make a clear public policy statement opposing these acts, we give the attackers the impression that their abhorrent behavior is acceptable. That is why I have sponsored amendments to The Civil Rights Act, H.R. 365, which would give Federal civil rights protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. But we must go beyond anti-discrimination laws; we must ensure that there is a Federal statute to punish the perpetrators of bias-based attacks.', u'It is my fervent hope that the biggest failure of the 105th Congress will not be repeated in the 106th Congress. Let us pass a Federal hate crimes bill as our first order of business in January.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/21/E2306_the-biggest-failure-of-the-105th-congress-no-hate-/'}
