There has been a staggering increase in the price of oil and gasoline which is having a huge impact on working families in this country. Their weekly earnings have risen less than one-half of 1 percent over the last 5 years, yet the cost of gasoline has more than doubled over that same period of time.", "These charts and graphs give an indication of what has happened to the price. Beginning in 2000, it was $1.47. Just last week, in my hometown in Connecticut, the price ranged from $3.15 per gallon to $3.35 per gallon, depending upon the quality of fuel you were buying, and the national average is creeping closer to $3.00 per gallon. We have seen the price of oil soar from just over $30 per barrel in 2001 to an excessive $75 per barrel this week. Most of us are aware, with the existing product from previously dug wells around the world, large profits can be made at $30 and $40 per barrel. So when you start talking about $75 per barrel, you get some indication of the level of profits that are being made.", "I mentioned what it is like for people out there who are struggling to make ends meet and hold their families together. Weekly earnings have risen only .4 percent since 2001, adjusted for inflation, while gasoline prices have risen 130.5 percent since that same year, adjusted for inflation. When you start talking about people on fixed incomes or people earning the minimum wage, the problem becomes more pronounced. We have gone 9 years now with no increase whatsoever in the federal minimum wage. We tried here only a few weeks ago, prior to the Fourth of July recess, for a $2.10 per hour increase in the minimum wage over the next several years, from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. That is a very modest increase in that minimum wage, but it would make a huge difference for people out there who are trying to make ends meet.", "Again, we have a limited time to talk about this, but Senator Dorgan and I are once again going to ask our colleagues to consider the idea of a rebate going back to people who are trying to make ends meet. We ask, when you have profits in excess of $40 per barrel, to either invest those profits back into the development of new product or new technologies or rebate part of those profits back to consumers.", "I know the Presiding Officer cares deeply about this issue and has lectured us on numerous occasions about the importance of supply. I don't fault the industry for trying to make a profit. What I would like to know is, are the companies investing in production, alternative sources of energy, and new technology? I would like to know they are going to do something, in addition to making a profit, that will actually increase our domestic supply.", "We wake up today to find the region of the world on which we depend tremendously for our supplies is literally aflame, a tinderbox that is exploding while we are gathered here. Yet we sit around here almost pretending that nothing is wrong as we continue to watch oil and gasoline prices skyrocket and oil companies record huge profits.", "One of the major oil companies, in its 2004 annual report, told its shareholders:", "We achieved the highest net income in our history, $18.2 billion. This was 48 percent higher than in 2003, as a result of higher oil and gas prices.", "So they recognize themselves that their profits are occurring because of these skyrocketing prices. Why not put some of those resources into developing alternatives, or doing a better job to see to it we become less dependent on the Venezuelas and the Middle East for our supplies? And if not, why not rebate some of the profits back to people who are struggling to make ends meet?", "Senator Dorgan and I are asking the leaders to provide us a limited amount of time to debate oil and gasoline prices and other energy issues. Nothing has captivated the attention of our public as has this issue. I don't know why we can't find some time to talk about ideas to provide relief to people we represent. We spent more time in the last couple of weeks talking about gay marriage and flag burning. How about gasoline prices?", "How about saying to the American public: Listen to the ideas we have to reduce the pressure you are feeling economically. That would be a welcome surprise to most Americans, to hear us talk about something they deeply care about. At the appropriate time, the Senator from North Dakota and I will be offering some language, once again asking our colleagues to join us in a bipartisan way to see if we can't encourage the industry to do something more than just brag about its profits.", "I yield the floor."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/07/13/S7454_energy-prices/"}
