Furthermore, Article VI of the Constitution states, ``. . . but no religious test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.'' Additionally, the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from the ``establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''", u"Ron Rankin, a Kootenai County Commissioner from Ceour d' Alene, Idaho delivered a powerful speech embodying these principles on November 28, 1998. I urge all my colleagues to read Mr. Rankin's words to see how much we need God's guidance in today's world:", u"Our prisons are full. Our jails are full. Crime is rampant in our streets. Our children's minds are corrupted by the media and their bodies by drugs. The cost of criminal justice is sapping our tax dollars to the extent that we are using funds better spent on education just to maintain our detention and correction facilities to protect our families from criminals. In spite of these indisputable facts, 26 states and numerous counties and cities that have passed resolutions supporting ``Read Your Bible Week'' in an effort to encourage people to return to the moral absolutes contained therein, are now being challenged in court. The American Civil Liberties Union and their liberal supporters are determined to protect us--not from criminals but from ``God'', claiming a separation of church and state clause that does not exist in the Constitution--that glorious standard written by men raised up by God unto that very purpose. On July 4th, 1776, there was, signed in the city of Philadelphia, one of America's historic documents which preceded the divinely inspired Constitution--The Declaration of Independence. It marked the birth of this nation, which, under God, was destined to be the cradle of freedom. We often forget that in declaring independence from an earthly power, our forefathers made a forthright Declaration of Dependence upon Almighty God. The closing words of this great document solemnly declare ``With a firm reliance on the protection of providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives--our fortunes--and our sacred honor''. The fifty-six courageous men who signed that document knew this was not just high-sounding rhetoric--and that if they succeeded, the best they could expect would be years of struggle in a new nation. If they lost, they would face the hangman's noose as traitors. Of the fifty-six, few were long to survive. Five were captured by the British and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes sacked, looted, occupied by the enemy or burned. Two lost their sons in the army. One had sons captured. Fifty-six died in war from its hardships--or its bullets. John Quincy Adams penned these words: ``Posterity--you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make good use of it.'' For years we flourished as a Christian nation. The Supreme Court, in an 1892 decision, declared: ``Our laws and our institutions must be based upon and embody the teachings of the Redeemer of Mankind. It is impossible that it should be otherwise; and to this extent, civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian! ``This in a religious people!'' ``This is historically true. From the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation--we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth--that this is a Christian nation.'' This from the Supreme Court: 1892. In this century, our great nation began to crumble morally. In June of 1962 the Supreme Court, which once ruled that America was a Christian Nation, declared prayer in public schools to be unconstitutional. The Bible and God Himself, were expelled. This in spite of the fact that America's greatest leaders have shown no doubt about God's proper place in the American government! Every session of the House and Senate begins with prayer-- each house has its own Chaplain. The Eighty-third Congress set aside a small room in the capital, just off the rotunda, for the private prayer and meditation of members of Congress. The room's focal point is a stained glass window showing George Washington knelling in prayer. Behind him is etched these words from Psalms 16:1 ``Preserve me, O God for in thee do I put my trust.'' Inside the rotunda is a picture of the Pilgrims about to embark on the sister ship of the Mayflower--the Speedwell. The ship's revered chaplain, Brewster, who later join the Mayflower, has open on his lap, the Bible. Very clear are the words, ``The New Testament, according to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.'' On the sail is the motto of the Pilgrims--IN GOD WE TRUST, GOD BE WITH US.'' The phrase, ``In God We Trust'' appears opposite the President of the Senate, who is the Vice President of the United States. The same phrase, in large words inscribed in marble, backdrops the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Above the head of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are the Ten Commandments, with the Great American eagle protecting them. Moses is included among the great lawgivers in a marble sculpture on the east front. The crier who opens each session, closes with these words; ``God save the United States and the Honorable Court.'' Engraved on the metal cap on top of the Washington Monument are the words: ``Praise Be To God.'' Lining the walls of the stairwell are such biblical phrases as, ``Search the Scriptures'', ``Holiness to the Lord'', ``Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.'' Numerous quotations from the scriptures can be found within the walls of the Library of Congress. One reminds each American of this responsibility to his Maker. ``What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.'' (Micah 6:8) Another preserves the psalmists acknowledgement that all nature reflects the order and beauty of the Creator: ``The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handwork.'' (psalm 19:1) And still another reference: ``The Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.'' (John 1:5) I, like millions of others, have stood in the Lincoln Memorial and gazed up at the statute of the great Abraham Lincoln. The sculptor who chiseled the features of Lincoln in granite seems to make Lincoln speak his own words inscribed into the walls: ``* * * that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.'' At the opposite end, on the north wall, his second inaugural address alludes to ``God'', ``the Bible'', ``Providence'', ``The Almighty'' and ``divine attributes.'' And then continues: ``As was said three thousand years ago, and so it still must be said, `The judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.' '' At the Jefferson Memorial on the south banks of Washington's tidal basin, Jefferson still speaks: ``God who gave us life, gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever.'' This is indeed an explicit warning to us. Especially to us in this day that, to allow God to be removed from this country, will surely destroy it. A result of our lack of resolve--the once Great American Dream is turning into a spiritual nightmare. America has rejected God in dealing with the issues of life. When God fades from a nation's conscience, one can justify almost anything. For example: God says: ``Thou shalt not kill.'' Americans have given murder a new name and now abort one and one half million babies a year. Many try to camouflage sin with new age terminology. God calls it ``Drunkenness.'' We call it alcoholism--a social disease. God calls it ``Sodomy.'' We call it homosexuality--gay rights--an ``Alternative Lifestyle.'' God calls it ``Perversion.'' We call it pornography--``Adult'' entertainment. God calls it ``Immorality.'' We call it the ``New'' morality. God calls it ``Cheating.'' We call it abnormal social development. With the erosion of moral absolutes Jefferson's warning should make us all shudder as each succeeding generation drifts further from the moral absolutes of the Lord. As revealed in the scriptures and banned by the courts from our schools, the words of a great Christian reformer, Martin Luther, become prophetic. ``I am much afraid that schools will prove to be great gates of Hell unless they diligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures, engraving them in the hearts of youth. I advise no one to place his child where the scriptures do not reign paramount. Every institution in which men are not increasingly occupied with the work of God must become corrupt.'' And on occasions when we pay tribute to and acknowledge the sacrifices of those men raised up by the Lord to establish and sustain our independence, we must re-dedicate ourselves to protecting and preserving those liberties and the righteous, God-fearing ideals that have been fought and died for by patriots throughout our American history. In two hundred and twenty-two years, Americans have fought many wars from Valley Forge to the far-flung corners of the earth. From the bloody beaches of Normandy to the island by island war in the Pacific, to the frozen mountains of the Chosin Reservoir, millions of young Americans have given their lives for the freedoms vouchsafed by our divinely- inspired Constitution . . . for this nation under God. In all of these wars fought on the field of battle, our enemies were definable. They wore uniforms. They fought with bayonets, grenades, rifles, cannons, mortars. A far more insidious enemy faces us today and we must prepare our youth for a more hard-fought battle for survival than we have ever known! Girded up in the Armor of Truth and Knowledge and in the strength of our families, our youth will not be fighting in trenches, foxholes or storming beaches. The enemy is amongst us and not in uniform. His weapons are the media, new age philosophies designed to deceive and destroy the moral character of our youth. Perversion, disguised as tolerance. Their battlefield will be the city halls, the county courthouses, state legislatures and the Congress. They must be prepared and we must prepare them that they may hold high, with new resolve, the Title of Liberty in memory of our God, our religion and freedom and our peace and our wives and children. In Patrick Henry's words: ``The enemy is in the field. Why stand we here idle?'' May God bless us all with continued freedom. May God bless our youth with the strength and resolve to bear the burden our complacency has placed upon them. And may God continue to bless America."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/1999/03/09/E373-4_speech-of-ron-rankin/'}
