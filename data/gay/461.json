As Dennis enters the next phase in his life and his family and friends gather to celebrate his illustrious career, I ask that all my colleagues join me in honoring his many remarkable accomplishments.", "For the last 27 years, Dennis has been a tireless pioneer for the cable industry. As a chief lobbyist and then the head of the California Cable & Telecommunications Association, Dennis has garnered many accolades for his efforts. In 1994, he was given the Brad Wojcoski Award, an honor reserved to recognize a cable and telecommunications industry employee whose efforts have made a significant impact in the fight against HIV and AIDS in their local community. In 1998 he received the Vanguard Award, which is the cable industry's highest decoration for outstanding service at the State and regional level. And in 2004, Dennis was inducted into the Cable Center's Cable Pioneer Exhibit, which applauds groundbreaking leaders in the cable industry.", "In addition to his invaluable work in the private sector for the cable industry, Dennis has had an impressive career in the public sector. His remarkable journey began as a teacher in the Long Beach Unified School District in 1964. As an educator, Dennis worked diligently to ensure that every child received equal access to quality education. In 1968, he became one of California's youngest school principals, serving first at the Earlimart Elementary School in Tulare and later at the Fountain Valley Elementary School in Orange County.", "Dennis's devotion to improving our educational system continued with him as a California State Assemblyman. Elected in 1976, he quickly became the chair of the Subcommittee on Educational Reform. This allowed him to lead the State Legislative Task Force for the Improvement of Pre- and In-Service Training for School Administrators. This program helped recruit teachers and school administrators for California's educational system. Additionally, during his time in the Assembly, Dennis authored the Gifted and Talented Education Act (GATE). The GATE program is now a staple of California's educational system and allows for unique educational opportunities for students who have been identified as high achieving.", "From his love for singing, to his enthusiasm for education, to his years giving back to the public as an elected official, Dennis has experienced many great things in his lifetime while also being active with many nonprofits. Throughout his career Dennis has championed tolerance and appreciation of diversity in the Sacramento region and across California. Dennis was a founding member and currently serves as the chairman of the board of directors for the Capitol Unity Council. The council was formed after the murder of a gay couple and the torching of three of Sacramento's synagogues in 1999. The council works to promote tolerance in the community, and Dennis has been leading the effort to build a center for diversity in downtown Sacramento. Thanks to his vision, this project is moving forward and upon completion will serve as an interactive learning experience where youth and visitors will engage in programs and activities that embrace inclusion, honor California's diversity, and motivate people to play an active role in building unity in their communities.", "Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize the numerous contributions made by Dennis during his lifetime of service. During his career he has worked tirelessly to further causes he believes in and has touched many people's lives both directly and indirectly. On behalf of the people of Sacramento and the Fifth Congressional District of California, I ask all my colleagues to join me in thanking my friend, Dennis Mangers, for his public service as we wish him success in his future endeavors."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/06/11/E1199-4_in-recognition-of-dennis-mangers/"}
