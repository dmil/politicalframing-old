It has done a tremendous disservice to the men and women who want nothing more than to defend our country, and it is time for this policy to go. I want to begin this afternoon by talking about a true hero from my home State of Washington named Margaret Witt.', u'She joined the Air Force in 1987 and served honorably for 18 years as a flight nurse--rising to the rank of major. She was described in reviews and by her peers as being an exemplary officer, an effective leader, and a skilled and caring nurse.', u"But in 2004 her superiors discovered she was a lesbian and, acting under don't ask, don't tell policy they suspended and ultimately discharged her. Margaret lost the job she had given her life to, and our country lost a talented and committed flight nurse.", u"She did not give up. She went to court. She called witnesses. She made her case. In September of this year, U.S. District Judge Ronald Leighton ruled that she must be reinstated. Judge Leighton said the government gave no compelling reason for dismissing Major Witt, and that the application of don't ask, don't tell was not shown to further the government's interest in promoting military readiness.", u'That was the right decision, and it was amazing news for Major Witt. She is now working with disabled veterans in Spokane, WA, but she says she is excited to get back in the air and back to helping the troops who need her.', u'Major Witt is a true hero. Her commitment to our country should be recognized and honored. But she should never have been put in this position. She has the skills, the experience, and the commitment to do her job. The fact that she is a lesbian does not change that one bit.', u"There are so many reasons to repeal don't ask, don't tell and to do it now. This policy destroys lives. We have all heard stories like Margaret's. There are thousands like it, and for every one we hear there are so many more who suffer silently, whose lives and livelihoods are devastated--not because of something they did but because of who they are: men and women who are kicked out of the military or who are forced to lie to everyone they work with, who go to sleep petrified they will be found out about and discharged, and who wake up dreading another day of mandated deceit and dishonesty.", u'It is wrong. It needs to end.', u"Don't ask, don't tell is depriving our armed services of talented men and women at a time when we need our best on the front lines defending America. We are fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we cannot afford to lose critical assets simply because they are gay.", u"Finally, we also know that repealing don't ask, don't tell will not have an adverse impact on the military. We have heard from military leaders who support this repeal. The Pentagon recently came out with their report that showed that repealing this policy would not inhibit their ability to carry out the missions they are charged with. ", u'In fact, that report said 70 percent of servicemembers believe repeal would have little to no effect on their units.', u"Repealing don't ask, don't tell is the right thing to do. It is right for our country. It is right for our military. It is right for Major Witt and thousands like her. It is right for people like Rebekah. She is a young woman from Spokane in my home State. She wrote me a letter a couple of months ago and told me she is a senior at Eastern Washington University, and her dream for years has been to join the U.S. Army. She wrote to me and said:", u'I believe the military is an honorable calling. One of self-sacrifice and dedication--and I would be proud to call myself a soldier.', u'But there was a problem. Rebekah told me the very sense of honor that called her to serve her country was preventing her from acting on her dream because she told me she is a lesbian. She is very proud of who she is. As long as the official policy of the United States Army is to ask her to bury that pride, to tell her to keep secret a large part of who she is, and to ask her to live what would essentially be a lie, she simply will not be able to serve our country.', u'Rebekah told me that nothing would make her happier than to be able to graduate this coming spring and start her journey standing up for our Nation. She does not want to feel that she should be ashamed of who she is, and she should not have to.', u"We need to repeal don't ask, don't tell so young women like Rebekah will not stop dreaming of growing up to serve our country, and so that every man and woman in our Armed Forces can serve their country openly and with pride. We have heard the stories of the lives this policy has ruined. We have heard from top-ranking military officials that it simply does not work. We have heard from servicemembers that they, too, want it to change. Today, this afternoon, with this historic vote, this country will move a step forward in being proud of every man and woman who serves their country.", u'For far too long, men and women with courage and commitment to serve our Nation have been asked to hide the truth about who they are. It is shameful. It is a bad policy. Today, it will end.', u'I look forward to the vote this afternoon and the courage of this Senate to stand up and do the right thing today.', u'Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/S10668-2_sbirsttr-reauthorization-act-of-1999-continued/'}
