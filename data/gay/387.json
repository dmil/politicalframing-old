During the course of this business meeting, no member of the Committee spoke in opposition to the nomination.", u"The problem is that the Senate has not been able to consider this nomination because some of our colleagues have put ``holds'' on it. Before adjourning last year, the Senate confirmed some 50 nominees, whose nominations had been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. The only nomination that languished was that of Jim Hormel and the reason for this is very obvious. Some of my colleagues oppose this nomination because Jim Hormel is openly gay. That means, in their view, that he is not fit to represent his country overseas in Luxembourg.", u"It doesn't matter that government officials in Luxembourg have been eager to support this nominee. It doesn't matter, apparently, that in his correspondence with our colleague Senator Smith from Oregon, Jim Hormel went on the record--in unprecedented fashion--in saying that he would not use his position as Ambassador to push any personal agenda, that his partner would not travel with him to Luxembourg, and his public positions would be those of the United States government only. All that matters, I suspect, for some members of this Senate, is that Jim Hormel is gay, that the most private and intimate elements of his lifestyle disqualify him from public service.", u"Mr. President, the issue is not and should not be Mr. Hormel's sexual orientation. The only relevant question here is whether he is qualified to undertake the position for which he has been nominated. The answer to that is ``yes''.", u'He has impressive academic credentials, having received his undergraduate degree from Swarthmore College and his J.D. from the University of Chicago. He has served as Assistant Dean and Dean of students at the University of Chicago. He currently sits on the board of managers of Swarthmore.', u"Jim Hormel is a loving father and grandfather, a businessman who ran a successful company for years, and a philanthropist who has supported, in his words but most importantly in his deeds, some of the most important causes facing this country. Outside the beltway, there's a chorus of very public support for this nominee. Those who care about autism, breast cancer research, AIDS research, religious diversity and human rights--they've all rallied together behind this nominee. The Episcopalian Archdiocese of California has called Jim Hormel ``an exemplary representative of the United States of America.'' Leaders from the business world, from the universities, and from diplomatic circles, including, I might add, former Secretary of State George Schultz, have stated publicly that James Hormel's public character and intellect make him an exceptionally strong nominee.", u"This is not the first time that Jim Hormel has been asked to serve his country. In 1995 he was a member of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Last year he was nominated to serve an alternative representative of the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly--a position subject to confirmation by the Senate. I want to remind my colleagues that no objection was raised to his nomination for this position, and the Senate confirmed him unanimously on May 23, 1997. In the final analysis, we've all got to make our private decisions about what we find acceptable, about which personal values we embrace. However, this Senator does not believe that private considerations should be used to deny an individual the right to hold a job for which he is qualified or to deny the full Senate its right to exercise its constitutional responsibility to act on a nomination. Those Senators standing in the way of this nomination should remove their ``holds'' and let the Senate work its will.
