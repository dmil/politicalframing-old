It was twenty years ago today that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the first report of what is now known as HIV/AIDS. I ask my colleagues to join with me today in renewing our commitment to conquer HIV and AIDS and to support efforts to end the spread of HIV.", "Today marks the beginning of the third decade with AIDS, and almost 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Here in the United States, increased social awareness and HIV/AIDs initiatives have created a perception that the AIDS pandemic is over. However, AIDS/HIV continues to destroy American families, neighborhoods, and communities. Women and children are especially susceptible to the disease. Between 1994 and 1998, the number of women living wth AIDS nearly doubled. Moreover, there are an estimated 120,000 to 160,000 women living with HIV. It is especially alarming that seventy-eight percent of the AIDS cases in American women ages 20-24 are minorities.", "Minorities account for over two thirds of the new AIDS cases reported in this country, and people of color account for more than half of AIDS cases worldwide. Children are fast becoming the innocent victims of HIV; the number of children living with HIV and AIDS is at an all-time high. Even communities that were leading in the battle against HIV/AIDS have suffered set backs in the last few years. The gay community, which was the first community mobilize and educate itself shortly following its tidal wave of infections in the early 1980s, is seeing increases in infection rates that had long lingered between 3 and 5 percent. A recent report by the CDC suggests that there is resurgence of HIV infection in the gay community, especially among African-Americans and Hispanics.", "In comparison to other regions of the world, America has escaped the epidemic proportions of AIDS seen around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world. The United Nations reports that 25.3 million adults and children are infected with the HIV virus in the region, which has about 10% of the world's population but more than 70% of the worldwide total of infected people. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues who have worked tirelessly to the awareness of the members of this body of the conditions in Africa.", "Since the onset of HIV/AIDS in 1981, we here in Congress, have attempted to address the issue. Not knowing of the complications and aggression of HIV/AIDS, in FY81 the Department of Health and Human Services received $200,000 in discretionary funding for HIV/AIDS. Today, Health and Human services receives close to $5 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, and the overall federal government spends close to $12 billion on programs for HIV/AIDS research, education, and prevention. This funding allows agencies such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support programs for state and local prevention activities. Programs ", "In 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. I am proud to say that here in this sometimes divisive body, we were able to come together and vote unanimously for the reauthorization of the Act in 2000, thereby assisting metropolitan areas and states with their health care costs and support services for individuals and families affected by HIV/AIDS. This legislation is vital to helping those who are most affected by this disease and who often do not have the means to combat this disease. Shortly after we passed the Ryan White CARE Act, I received a letter from a former student of mine who has been living with AIDS. In her touching letter, my former student applauded our efforts here in Congress, ``I am very pleased that we have seen an increase in funding for the Ryan White CARE Act to help those living with this horrible disease and all of their families too. Now, hopefully with all the funds we can care for a lot of people and try to keep them as well as possible...''", "Mr. Speaker, we cannot jeopardize the well being of those living with HIV/AIDS and must ensure that funding for HIV/AIDS is retained. I commend the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Pelosi, and the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, whom I have joined in sending a letter to encourage President Bush to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) programs. The letter also encourages President Bush to support funding for disease prevention, the Ryan White CARE Act to improve health care for people with AIDS, and the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative. With rates of infection on the up swing and so concentrated, we cannot let these programs lag; the risk is too high.", "It is paramount that we persevere in our efforts against HIV/AIDS. As we begin our third decade battling this disease, I maintain that we focus our energies on those who are most vulnerable to infections: women, minorities, and children. We must also redouble our efforts to educate our citizens, especially our youth, on how to protect themselves from HIV infection. In addition, we must not ignore our humanitarian duty to those suffering around the world. The strides we have made in the past two decades are numerous; and we should celebrate our victories. However, we cannot overlook the individuals who are unable to fight this disease alone. I ask my colleagues, on this the 20th anniversary of the AIDS/HIV, to remember the past and stand in solidarity to renew our nation's commitment to this global crisis."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/06/05/E1005-3_commemorating-the-twentieth-anniversary-of-hivaids/"}
