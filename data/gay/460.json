Since that time she has taken full advantage of the myriad opportunities available to those of us who are lucky enough to come of age in America. She has excelled academically, mastering the English language at an early age, participating in her primary school's Gifted Child program, and winning the prestigious American Legion Award for writing.", u"At Palatine High School, she participates in the Foreign Language Honor Society and placed as top sophomore in the Illinois Math League contest. In addition to these intellectual accomplishments, Anna is a talented pianist, a member of her school's choir and newspaper, and a dedicated athlete, running on the varsity cross country and track teams. Appropriately, she was nominated to Palatine High School's A-Team for achieving excellence in Athletics, Activities, Arts and Attitude.", u'When Anna applied to come to the House of Representatives as a page, she told me that she wanted to do so not only because of the unique opportunity to take part in our democratic process, but also in order to give back to her country. She certainly held up her part of the bargain, serving honorably as a Congressional Page while excelling within the academic curriculum at the Page School.', u'At the Page Departure Ceremony at the end of her term, Anna received awards that demonstrate two of her most apparent attributes: intelligence and dedication. She was honored for her performance in the classroom--particularly her expertise in economics--with the Ronald Weitzel Award, which is awarded to one page each term who demonstrates excellence in social studies. She was also recognized as having perfect attendance this semester at the Page School.', u'At the close of her term as a page, Anna said that the firsthand view of Congress has not disillusioned her about our political process. Rather, she feels incredibly lucky to have spent her days on the floor of the House of Representatives, heard our impassioned debates over SCHIP in person, and been present when the Dalai Lama addressed Congress. She came to Washington interested in trade, immigration, and gay rights, and is leaving passionate about the same issues but with more nuanced views on them.', u"Anna said while she has loved her time as a Congressional Page, she is also excited to return to Illinois to resume her extracurriculars that benefit others, including leading her school's chapter of Students for Obama in an effort to engage her fellow students in the political process. In the future, she plans to work in the public sector either as a diplomat or in some aspect of domestic politics.", u'Upon completing her term as a Congressional Page, Anna added another impressive accomplishment to her record. Just as importantly, she did so while maintaining something that many Americans often take for granted--optimism, hope, and belief in the potential of our democratic system.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/02/28/E267-3_recognizing-anna-novikova-for-her-service-as-a-con/'}
