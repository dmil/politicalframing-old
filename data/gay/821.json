It is with a deep sense of sadness that I pay tribute to the passing of Stewart R. Mott, founder of the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust and the Fund for Constitutional Government and a great progressive leader. Stewart died on June 12th after a year-long battle with cancer, and a memorial service in his honor was held last week in New York City.', u'In a few weeks, I am publishing a memoir that I titled A Renegade for Peace and Justice. I am also reminded that Stewart Mott was truly a giant renegade for peace and justice. Born to a life of wealth and privilege, he took a different path and led a remarkable life of passionate commitment to exploration, discovery, and social change. He also put his good fortune literally and figuratively to remarkably good use, providing essential funding to countless progressive organizations and electoral and issue campaigns dedicated to improving the lot of the downtrodden, promoting peace, and zealously defending the civil rights and civil liberties endowed to each of us in our precious U.S. Constitution.', u"Stewart Mott lived the philosophy of the Mott family crest, Spectemur Agendo, which translates ``Let us be known by our deeds.'' As many of his friends and associates have noted, he will also be remembered for his great sense of humor, his great generosity, his deeds as a pioneering philanthropist, and his undaunted commitment to building a better democracy.", u'America is hungry for change and I am saddened that Stewart Mott did not live long enough to witness a resurgent progressive movement deliver many of the 21st century changes that will be required to move our country and our world toward more peace and justice. But without his resolve and extraordinary generosity, prospects for lasting progress toward a more perfect Union in America would be far dimmer, as is underscored by the following obituary for Stewart Mott that appeared in the New York Times on June 14, 2008:', u"Stewart R. Mott, a philanthropist whose gifts to progressive and sometimes offbeat causes were often upstaged by his eccentricities, like cultivating a farm with 460 plant species (including 17 types of radishes), a chicken coop and a compost pile, atop his Manhattan penthouse, died Thursday night. He was 70 and had homes in North Salem, N.Y. and Bermuda. His death was confirmed Friday morning by Conrad Martin, executive director of the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust. He said Mr. Mott had been ill with cancer for some time and died in the emergency room of Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mr. Mott's philanthropy included birth control, abortion reform, sex research, arms control, feminism, civil liberties, governmental reform, gay rights and research on extrasensory perception. His political giving, often directed against incumbent presidents, was most visible. In 1968, he heavily bankrolled Senator Eugene McCarthy's challenge to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Four years later, he was the biggest contributor to Senator George McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee. When Charles W. Colson, the White House chief counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, included Mr. Mott in the famed ``enemies list,'' Mr. Colson said of him, ``nothing but big money for radic-lib candidates.'' After the 1974 campaign finance law outlawed exactly the sort of large political gifts in which Mr. Mott specialized, he joined conservatives to fight it as an abridgement of free expression. They argued that limits on contributions given independently of a candidate's organization were unconstitutional. In 1976, the Supreme Court agreed, while keeping other parts of the law. Mr. Mott then became expert on devising ways to give to candidates under the new rules. Following conservatives' precedents, he formed political action committees and became an expert on direct mail, using both as methods of collecting many small donations. Still, his ability to help the independent presidential candidacy of Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois in 1980 was curbed somewhat; gone were the days when he could simply write a big check and directly hand it to Mr. McCarthy or Mr. McGovern. Some argued that the financing restrictions diminished the chances that surprise candidates could emerge from the grass roots and be propelled to national prominence by well-placed benefactors. Bradley A. Smith, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, wrote in the Yale Law Journal in 1996 that Mr. Anderson's losing independent bid might have fared better had Mr. Mott not been so effectively leashed. Irreverent, good-looking and effusive, Mr. Mott seemed tailor-made for the 1960s and '70s, when he attracted his widest attention, not least for his all-too-candid comments about everything from his sex partners (full names spelled out in newsletters) to his father's parental deficiencies (``a zookeeper'') to his blood type (AB+). He once lived on a Chinese junk as a self-described beatnik and kept notes to himself on Turkish cigarette boxes, accumulating thousands. He held folk music festivals to promote peace and love. His garden atop his Manhattan penthouse (which he sold some years ago) was famous; at one point Mr. Mott taught a course in city gardening at the New School for Social Research in New York. He once told an interviewer that he lay awake wondering how to grow a better radish. Mr. Mott seemed to relish poking his finger in the eye of General Motors, a company that his father, Charles Stewart Mott, helped shape as an early high executive. In the '60s, the younger Mr. Mott drove a battered red Volkswagen with yellow flower decals when he drove at all. He lambasted G.M. at its annual meeting for not speaking out against the Vietnam War. He gave money to a neighborhood group opposing a new G.M. plant because it would involve razing 1,500 homes. Mr. Mott broke into politics in 1968, when he used newspaper advertisements to pledge $50,000 to the as-yet- nonexistent presidential candidacy of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York if others would contribute double that amount. When Mr. Rockefeller rejected his efforts, Mr. Mott turned to Mr. McCarthy. In 1972, Mr. Mott ran what some regarded as a scurrilous ad campaign against Senator Edmund S. Muskie, a rival of Mr. McGovern's in his own Democratic Party. This led to Mr. Mott's being called before the Senate Watergate Committee, which was investigating political ``dirty tricks.'' It found no wrongdoing by him. Mr. Mott devoted himself to military reform by financing the Project on Military Procurement and the Center for Defense Information, among other left-leaning projects. In 1979, a report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said these activities added up to an ``anti- defense lobby.'' In 1974, Mr. Mott started the Fund for Constitutional Government to expose and correct corruption in the federal government. His mansion in Washington has long been used to raise funds for candidates, as well as causes from handgun control to gay rights. At a 1982 soiree, he brought in an elephant and two donkeys, presumably to demonstrate political balance. Mr. Mott paid most of the early legal fees for a 1976 suit that ultimately caused former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew to repay kickbacks ($147,599 plus interest) that he had been accused of receiving when he was governor of Maryland. Mr. Agnew, who had resigned the vice presidency after pleading no contest to a tax evasion charge, did not admit guilt. Mr. Mott officially told the election agency that his job was ``maverick.'' He listed himself as ``philanthropist'' in the Manhattan phone book. (Space limitations precluded his preferred ``avant-garde philanthropist.'') Stewart Rawlings Mott was born on Dec. 4, 1937, in Flint, Mich. He was the son of Charles Stewart Mott and the former Ruth Rawlings, Mr. Mott's fourth wife. They also had two daughters. Mr. Mott and his first wife, the former Ethel Culbert Harding, had a son and two daughters. She died in 1924. Mr. Mott's middle two marriages yielded no children. Charles Mott took over one of the family's businesses, manufacturing wheels and axles, and in 1906 moved this company from Utica, N.Y., to Flint, Mich., to take advantage of the auto industry's rapid growth. By 1913, he had sold the company to General Motors for G.M. stock, becoming G.M.'s largest individual shareholder. He became a director of the company, serving for 6o years until his death in 1973 at 97. He accumulated interests in many other companies, and in 1926 established the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, a major philanthropy. Stewart, the second child of the second wave of children, was born when his father was 62. This gap, when combined with the father's standoffish manner, created an immense chasm. The father signed notes to his son, ``Very truly yours, C. S. Mott,'' and hired a coach to teach him to ride a bike. Stewart was overweight as a child and nearly drowned at 9 when he ventured out on thin ice. After running away at 11, he struck a bargain with his father to come home half the summer if he could work the other half at family enterprises. His experiences included a Flint department store, a pecan- and-goose farm in New Mexico and a refrigerator plant near Paris. He attended Michigan public and private schools until he was 13, and then entered Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts, from which he graduated. He studied engineering for three years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then hitchhiked around the world for a year, spending just $1,500. He finished his education at the Columbia University School of General Studies, earning two bachelor's degrees, one in business administration and one in comparative literature, as well as a Phi Beta Kappa key. After his Chinese junk kept sinking in the Hudson, he abandoned it for terrestrial accommodations. He wrote a thesis on Sophocles for a never- completed Columbia master's degree in Greek drama. While pursuing his education, Mr. Mott worked as an apprentice in various family enterprises. In the academic year of 1963-64, he taught English at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Mich. His philanthropy began when he returned to Flint and started the city's first branch of Planned Parenthood. He then traveled the nation on behalf of Planned Parenthood. Newly enamored by philanthropy, he asked to join his father's foundation, which mainly served Flint. Father said no, so Stewart used trust funds to start his own charity. He moved to New York in 1966, and did not speak to his father for a year. He said in an interview in 1971 with The New Yorker: ``Right now, my philanthropy is hearty, robust, full-bodied, but it still needs a few years of aging before it will develop fully its eventual clarity, delicacy, elegancy, fruitiness, and fragrance.'' What happened over the years was that it became more low- key, even as Mr. Mott pursued the same range of causes. On its Web site, the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust said it looks for projects ``seeking tangible change.'' For years, Mr. Mott was a highly publicized eligible bachelor. When the Washington Post reported that he had slept with 40 women over an eight-month period, he issued a correction, saying the number was actually 20. In 1979, he married Kappy Wells, a sculptor. They divorced in 1999. He is survived by a son, Sam, of Santa Fe, N.M., and a sister, Maryanne Mott, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Montana. In 1969, Mr. Mott gave a huge party at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan to celebrate his father's 94th birthday. The older man earlier that day accepted a ride in his son's Volkswagen. He said it was bumpy."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/07/23/E1536-4_in-tribute-to-stewart-r-mott/'}
