Since the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, passed, which will allocate $48 billion in Federal money towards fighting this epidemic in Africa, she is now pushing to have some of the money go towards battling HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. There are 14 Caribbean nations that could get some of the money, including Jamaica where her mother is from. This is a great initiative that Debra Fraser-Howze has made. With her leadership, I am confident that she will be able to get funds from PEPFAR to go towards fighting this epidemic in the Caribbean.", u'Again, I commend Debra Fraser-Howze for her determination to find cures, provide funding and to educate people about HIV/AIDS around the world.', u"There's growing optimism for fighting AIDS in the Caribbean region as billions of dollars become available to fund programs aimed at preventing and containing the disease. With $48 billion in federal money being set aside to battle the disease in Africa, the Caribbean is actively seeking to qualify for a share. The funds will be allocated through a U.S. foreign aid program known as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). It is the largest commitment in history by any nation to fight a single disease. ``It's going to open doors to a new stream of funding where those doors were not open before,'' said Debra Fraser-Howze, a long-time HIV/AIDS advocate. ``The Caribbean will have the same positioning as some of those African nations with whom they share a similar AIDS situation.'' Fraser-Howze has been helping to lead the fight against HIV/AIDS for more than two decades. She founded the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS in 1987 and subsequently advised two presidents while she served on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. In 2003 she was appointed to the New York City Commission on AIDS and last year to the New York State Governors Advisory Council. Fraser-Howze is now vice president of External and Government Affairs for OraSure Technologies, a medical diagnostics company. While her responsibilities with the company focus on domestic matters, she remains an active advocate for anti-AIDS funding for the Caribbean. ``It's a personal issue with me,'' Fraser-Howze said, ``because I know the numbers, and I see the rising rate of infection.'' That's why she's resolute about the funding, especially since the Caribbean did not receive any of the initial PEPFAR money, which became available in 2003. ``The Caribbean islands to which Americans travel all the time need to get the same focus as Africa,'' she said. There are 14 Caribbean nations that could get some of the new money. They are Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. Any PEPFAR money they receive will be for AIDS testing, prevention, treatment and care. Fraser-Howze is quick to credit U.S. Rep. Donna Christiansen of the U.S. Virgin Islands for taking the lead in getting those nations included in the PEPFAR funding. ``I've known her for more than 25 years, and I've worked with her and her staff on this issue. We understand that it is imperative that the Caribbean have a robust testing initiative,'' Fraser-Howze said. But, she added, even with funding the battle against AIDS is truly difficult in the Caribbean because the region's culture is almost an ally of the disease. Fraser-Howze's mother is from Jamaica so she has knowledge of the cultural barriers to AIDS testing. ``Sex and drugs are very taboo topics in the Caribbean, and there is a lot of homophobia because the disease is very much focused on gay men,'' she said. ``That is why the key to testing in the Caribbean is to have those barriers broken down by the community itself. ``I've seen government send in different people and different groups who are not culturally competent. The best approach is for Caribbean nations to develop their own plan. We want them to craft their own proposals to PEPFAR.'' Fraser-Howze cited Barbados as already having ``a major HIV/AIDS initiative.'' She said she's ``extremely optimistic'' the Caribbean will get PEPFAR money and, she added, ``I'm humbled at playing some small role in opening up this opportunity.''"], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2008/11/20/E2317_paying-special-tribute-to-an-hivaids-activist/'}
