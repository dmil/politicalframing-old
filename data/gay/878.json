Jacobs on their recent selection as Professors of the Year. It is a major accomplishment as only four awards are given out nationally, one for each classification of institution. Mr. Adams was recognized as Outstanding Baccalaureate College Professor of the Year and Dr. Jacobs was recognized as Outstanding Research and Doctoral University Professor of the Year.", "I am particularly proud, Mr. President, because Mr. Adams and Dr. Jacobs are two of four national Professors of the Year, and my home state of Indiana is the home for both. Both Mr. Adams and Dr. Jacobs represent the very best in higher education and Hoosier values.", "Mr. James Adams is a professor of art at Manchester College in North Manchester, Indiana. During 42 years at Manchester, Mr. Adams has taught in the Art, English, Music, and Spanish departments, driven by his interest in new technologies, integrating service with learning, and interdisciplinary approaches to subjects. He has truly set an example to the rest of the teaching community.", "In addition, Mr. Adams has been an exchange professor to Germany and Spain, and was instrumental in creating study-abroad programs on his campus. His international interest has also led him to supervise an Indiana University summer program in England, serve as faculty-in-residence for DePauw University in Spain, and he has conducted at least 20 student tours to Mayan sites.", "Mr. James Adams' hobbies have also brought him success. He is a practicing painter and photographer who has exhibited throughout the United States and in England, Mexico, and Spain. A contributor to his community, Mr. Adams is a frequent lecturer at the Fort Wayne Museum of Art, and he also does pro bono work with the local Department of Motor Vehicles office, serving as a translator for Latino residents new to the area.", "Mr. Adams earned undergraduate degrees at George Washington University and the Concoran School of Art, with a double major in Art and Modern Languages. He holds a Master of Fine Arts at the Instituo Allende, which is affiliated with the University of Guanajuato, Mexico, and he spent three years at the Ruskin School of Art at Oxford University.", "Dr. Dennis C. Jacobs is a professor of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. At Notre Dame, he has won several teaching awards and the Presidential Award for dedicated service to the University. His contribution to the learning community is evident.", "In 1999, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching named him a Carnegie Scholar largely for completely redesigning an important introductory chemistry class. The redesign led to greater student success and engagement, and the course is considered a leading example of the trend toward peer-led curricula. This is a remarkable accomplishment.", "Dr. Jacobs has also combined chemistry and service learning, creating a course in which students and community partners evaluate lead contamination in area homes. He is also a Fellow with the Center for Social Concerns, focusing on other methods of integrating community service into the curriculum.", "His work has earned him great respect in his community. One of his colleagues has described him as ``the kind of teacher who never stops growing, thinking, and changing.''", "Dennis Jacobs earned undergraduate degrees at the University of California at Irvine in physics and chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry at Stanford University.", "Outstanding Baccalaureate Colleges: James Adams, Professor, Art, Manchester College, North Manchester, IN", "Outstanding Community Colleges: Alicia Juarrero, Professor, Philosophy, Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD", "Outstanding Doctor and Research Universities: Dennis Jacobs, Professor, Chemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN", "Outstanding Master's Universities and Colleges: Francisco Jimenez, Director of Ethnic Studies Program and Fay Boyle, Professor in the department of Modern Languages and Literatures, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA", "Alabama: Natalie Davis, Professor, Political Science, Birmingham-Southern College", "Alaska: Steven Johnson, Assistant Professor and Director of Debate, University of Alaska Anchorage", "Arizona: Christopher Impey, Professor, Astronomy, University of Arizona", "Arkansas: Gay Stewart, Associate Professor, Physics, University of Arkansas", "California: Cecilia Conrad, Associate Professor, Economics, Pamona College", "Colorado: Aaron Byerley, Professor, Aeronautical Engineering, United States Air Forces Academy", "Connecticut: Bruce Saulnier, Associate Professor, Computer Information Systems", "District of Columbia: James A.
