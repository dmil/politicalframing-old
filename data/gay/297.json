America would be well served to have a leader of his high caliber representing this country in Luxembourg.", "On the international level, he has recently completed his term as Alternate Representative of the U.S. Delegation to the 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He was confirmed by the Senate for that position in 1997. He was also a member of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. In 1995 he participated in President Clinton's Conference on the Pacific Rim.", "Jim Hormel is a talented lawyer who has shown his commitment to public service by establishing the James C. Hormel Public Service Program at the University of Chicago. This program is designed to encourage law students to enter careers in public service.", "Jim Hormel is also a dedicated and energetic community activist. He was instrumental in developing resources for organizations serving people affected by HIV and AIDS, and he serves on the board of directors of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Recently, he was honored by Breast Cancer Action for his leadership of the Men's Campaign Against Breast Cancer. He has also been a leader for human rights in his capacity as a director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.", "Jim Hormel is also a renowned philanthropist, and he has supported an impressively diverse array of causes, including the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, Jewish Family and Children's Services, the Catholic Youth Organization, the NAACP, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the Virginia Institute of Autism.", "It was entirely fitting that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly approved his nomination last November. At the time, no Senator spoke in opposition. Only after the meeting did two Senators ask to be recorded against the nomination.", "I share the concern expressed by other strong supporters of this nomination that action on Jim Hormel's confirmation is being delayed because he is gay. Delay on that basis would be irresponsible and unacceptable. Prejudice based on sexual orientation should have no place in this debate, no place in the Senate, and no place in America.", "It is long past time for the Senate to vote on this nomination. Jim Hormel will be an excellent ambassador for the United States, and deserves to be confirmed as soon as possible."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/03/31/S2848-3_nomination-of-james-c-hormel-as-ambassador-to-luxe/"}
