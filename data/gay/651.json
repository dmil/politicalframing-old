I appreciate working with him. We were able to pretty well decide when matters would come up and make sure that both Republicans and Democrats had a chance to bring up all their amendments, and we adopted 136 or so amendments, including second-degree amendments, and all but one or two of them were bipartisan votes. I appreciate what he said and I enjoyed working with him on that.', u'I will have more to say at another time about his amendment. But I just note for the past several days Senators have been discussing the immigration bill, and I am glad the Senate has now turned to actually consider it. We have had a lot of talk about getting to it, including, of course, the time spent in the Judiciary Committee.', u'I intend to file a handful of amendments to the bill today, and I would encourage others to do the same so we can get to work without further delay.', u'The bipartisan immigration bill is a measure the Senate should come together on to pass. We should send to the House the best bill we can, and I think the large majority of Senators want to do that.', u'We should do what is right, what is fair, and what is just. The House has to consider comprehensive immigration reform legislation without any further delay.', u'This year one of the most important bills we enacted into law was the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. From the outset I worked with my Republican colleague Senator Crapo to develop that legislation in a bipartisan way. We called in Senators from both sides of the aisle. We had cosponsors from both parties. We took suggestions and amendments from both Democrats and Republicans. Then we built a majority of Senators in support.', u'I worked very hard to keep that as a bipartisan issue when, frankly, we had some on both sides of the aisle who wanted to make it a partisan issue.', u"Last year we were able to have our bill considered. It passed the Senate with 68 votes--obviously, a bipartisan majority. Parenthetically, I would note that yesterday we passed the farm bill with fewer votes than that, but the New York Times described that farm bill, and rightly so, as having ``overwhelming bipartisan support.''", u'In fact, last fall, when the House of Representatives would not take up our VAWA legislation--the violence against women legislation--we redoubled our efforts during the lameduck session. We had many meetings in my office between Republicans and Democrats to find where we could go. We then reintroduced our bill with some modifications at the beginning of this year.', u'I sought to make it our first legislative priority of the new Congress. With the strong support and leadership of the majority leader Senator Reid, the Senate turned to it, we considered it, and we passed it as one of our very first legislative matters in February. We actually passed it with an even stronger bipartisan majority this year than last, although many of those who now oppose immigration reform continued voting against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. But we passed a strong, principled, bipartisan bill.', u'I had people urge me to abandon my efforts in the Violence Against Women Act to protect all victims. I was glad to see they were proven wrong. I was told repeatedly that the House of Representatives would never consider, let alone pass, our bill that provided fairness for gay and lesbian victims and that we would never be able to provide meaningful protections for Native American women being brutalized by non-Indians on reservations.', u'But I said from my own experience early as a prosecutor and since as chairman of the Judiciary Committee: A victim is a victim is a victim. When I would go to crime scenes, I never heard a police officer, who would see a victim of violence against women, say: Wait a minute. Before we can get involved, is this victim gay or straight? Is this victim Native American? They said a victim is a victim is a victim, and let us see what we can do to protect not only this person but others.', u'In spite of all the dire predictions and political naysayers, our bipartisan group of Senators stuck to our principles. The Senate stood firm. We did the right thing.', u'What happened then? How were we able to enact this bill into law?', u'The American people spoke up. They supported our bill. They demanded action. There were some Republican Members of the House, such as Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who knew the right thing to do and were willing to say they wanted to do it. Then more and more House Republicans came around to our view.', u'The House, to its credit, changed its stance and considered our bill. They passed it with no changes whatsoever--exactly as it came out of the Senate--and it is now law.', u'I was proud to stand with President Obama on March 7 in an emotional ceremony in which he thanked legislators from both sides of the aisle for protecting all victims of domestic violence and human trafficking.', u'Relevant to the pending immigration bill, there was one piece of the original Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill that was requested by law enforcement to help immigrant victims of violence. We sought to increase U visas for abused immigrant women so they could be protected and help law enforcement go after their abusers.', u'So often immigrant women are afraid to go and report their abusers because they think they themselves may be deported. In fact, we have had evidence and testimony that people are being abused. If they are immigrants, they are told: If you report what I am doing to you, I will get you deported.', u'That provision had a technical budget affect that last year the House used as an excuse not to consider our bill.', u'I promised at the beginning of this year that I would continue fighting to enact that measure. We would take it out of the VAWA bill to avoid the technicality of having it blocked by the House, but I never forgot that. I never forgot my promise to those immigrant women. I am happy to report that these important U visas are now part of comprehensive immigration reform legislation before us.', u"I tell this history because some have argued the Senate immigration reform bill has to be undermined from what we brought out of committee. We have to do that to conform to demands intended to appease some in the House Republican majority. I disagree. I disagree. Just as we did not back off on VAWA, I say: Do not do it now. Let's consider not a partisan reason, but let's consider America. The Senate should pass the best bill for the economy, for our families, and for our Nation. We should do what we think is right.", u"The House of Representatives is clearly in a different place than those who support the Senate bill. Just last Thursday House Republicans voted to end President Obama's administrative program to help DREAMers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, until such time as we can pass the DREAM Act.", u"The DREAM Act is in our Senate immigration reform bill. It recognizes that young people here without fault of their own, who are in school or in the military, and in good standing should not be deported because they are undocumented. They are Americans. They should be part of this Nation's future.", u'Senator Durbin--I am so proud of him for this--has been right to fight for them, as he has for years. He is a national voice for those who want the DREAM Act to pass. Senator Durbin has insisted on the DREAM Act being included in our legislation, and President Obama was right today to highlight the achievements and contributions these young people make to our country and will continue to make if the bill becomes law.', u"Should we now abandon them? Should we say let's just strike those measures from the Senate bill because Representative King of Iowa and other House Republicans do not like them? Of course not. The Senate is a separate body--100 people to represent over 300 million Americans--and we should be the conscience of our Nation. That means the Senate should do what is right if we are to reflect the conscience of the Nation.", u'I am inspired by the young DREAMers I have met over the last several years and by the courageous testimony of Juan Antonio Vargas and Gaby Pacheco during our hearings this year.', u'Our bill should include the DREAM Act, just as we should protect and include the fair but tough pathway to citizenship included in the bill reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee.', u"These provisions are the core of our bill. Let's not start negotiating against ourselves. Let's not start backing off what we came together to pass. The vote by the Republicans in the House of Representatives to prevent DREAMers from being able to stay in the United States is not the example that the Senate should follow, especially if we really want to be the conscience of the Nation.", u'A few days ago the New York Times had a lead editorial that accurately describes where we are. It cautions against making bad modifications to the bill. It urges bipartisanship and courage and that we stand up to bad politics and bad policy. I hope the Senate will heed this call.', u"I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this past Sunday's editorial be printed in the Record."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2013/06/11/S4093_border-security-economic-opportunity-and-immigrati/'}
