There is a fascinating number about the marines. A significant number of the marines are worried about this change in policy.

Someone called me up that day and said how thrilled they were, a member of another minority group, and said: You know, Joe, here is what is significant. When a barrier falls for one group of Americans, the doors of opportunity open wider for all Americans.", "I think we have that opportunity today to make our great country even greater, and our best-in-the-world military even better.", "I yield the floor."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2010/12/18/S10649-3_dont-ask-dont-tell/"}
