I am an original cosponsor of this legislation which would replace ``Don't Ask Don't Tell,'' with a non-discrimination policy for all military personnel.", u"A decade ago, ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' was enacted as a compromise to allow lesbian, gay and bisexual military personnel to serve honorably in the military as long as they didn't disclose their sexual orientation. It was a bad policy then and it's a bad policy now. It has resulted in the discharge of more than 10,000 dedicated and trained military personnel merely on the basis of their sexual orientation.", u'There are two issues this bill is addressing--military readiness and civil justice.', u"Military readiness is being compromised by discharging critically needed military linguists to fight the Global War on Terrorism. Shortly after September 11, 2001, we can vividly remember the frantic search for linguists, particularly Arabic and Farsi speakers. But because of ``Don't Ask Don't Tell,'' the Department of Defense has discharged 20 Arabic linguists and 6 Farsi linguists for no other reason than their sexual orientation. No one can dispute that these linguists, who attended the Defense Language Institute located in my congressional district, are mission essential to the Global War on Terrorism. If we didn't think so before, surely we can agree now that language capability and proficiency is just as much of a weapon system as guns and bullets.", u"Repealing ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' is just as much a civil justice issue. It has created a separate class of people who are discriminated against based solely on their sexual orientation. Sixty years ago our military was at the forefront of the civil rights struggle by accepting African Americans as soldiers, sailors and airmen. The Military Readiness Enhancement Act will extend a non-discrimination policy for sexual orientation much as it did in adopting a color-blind non-discrimination policy. Ending racism in the military, which produced military leaders like Colin Powell, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State, was an advancement of civil rights for all Americans.", u"The Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law for all citizens. Just because you decide to honorably serve your country by joining the military, doesn't mean you should have to forfeit the right to equal protection under the law."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/03/02/E340-2_repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell/'}
