While Outward Bound gave me unparalleled opportunities to satisfy a passion for mountain climbing and other experiences in the outdoors, I believe my participation and involvement in Outward Bound may have been most rewarding for me because it began a life-long interest in the question of how we work to fully develop human potential and in the dynamics of leadership.", u'The credo of Outward Bound is that every human being has the inner potential to become a leader. This potential can be unlocked in many ways, whether it is facing a 14,000 foot mountain climb, beginning a trek across miles of desert and wilderness, working with a group of inner city school children, building a shelter for those who are homeless, or comforting a person in need.', u'How leadership is awakened is less important than acknowledging the diversity of ways in which each one of us faces deep challenge, whether it is physical, emotional or as part of a collaborative venture with others.', u"Earlier this year, a group of Coloradans came together to celebrate the individual and collective challenge of leadership in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. These Coloradans were participants in an exhaustive and comprehensive national initiative called ``Leadership Challenge 2001: Connecting, Communicating, Collaborating'' sponsored by the Lundy Foundation, in partnership with the Gill Foundation and 40 other non-profit and corporate supporters.", u'Over the course of three years, 41 participants spent 56 days in intensive training sessions, addressing fundamental issues of trust, race, socioeconomic status, diversity and other challenges in building collaborative leadership within the LGBT community.', u"By vigorously addressing their own individual and communal issues, the participants in this innovative leadership training project also enhanced the potential of Colorado's LGBT community to address the needs and concerns of a much broader community, namely, the community we call ``America.''", u'As an enthusiast of leadership theory, I am very pleased to bring this initiative to the attention of my colleagues in this body, and to commend the project coordinates and the 32 participants who graduated from this program.', u'Their commitment and perseverance is admirable, and worthy of acknowledgement.', u'Please join me in recognizing their achievement today.', u'Victor Dukay, Ph.D.--Project Director and President of the Lundy Foundation; Harryl Hollingsworth, M.A.--Assistant Project Director; Carl Larson, Ph.D.--Curriculum Development/Faculty; Dora Lodwick, Ph.D.--Evaluator; Allan Wallis, Ph.D.--Evaluator.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2001/09/21/E1704_honoring-the-participants-of-leadership-2001/'}
