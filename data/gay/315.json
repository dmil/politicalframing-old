This Dulles center, which will be built without any Federal funds, will provide crucial additional exhibit space for displaying national aviation treasures to the public.", u'The current Air and Space Museum on the Mall is filled to capacity. There is no room to store any more of our large, invaluable aviation artifacts. These artifacts are currently stored in warehouses, hidden from the public, and some even stored outside, where they are exposed to the elements. The passage of S. 1995 places us on track to provide a safe and secure facility to house and preserve, for the public, these historical aircraft and spacecraft such as the B-29 Enola Gay, the Space Shuttle Enterprise, and the SR-71 Blackbird. This bill seeks to save these irreplaceable artifacts for our children and our future generations.', u"Mr. President, in 1946, President Truman, believing in the importance of preserving our historical aircraft, signed Public Law 722 establishing the National Air Museum. Twenty years later, in 1966, President Johnson understood the importance of this museum and signed the law authorizing construction of a National Air and Space Museum, which expanded the museum's collection efforts to include spacecraft and lunar artifacts. This museum was built on the National Mall here in Washington, opening its doors in 1976 and becoming the world's most visited museum, averaging over 8 million visitors per year.", u"In keeping with this tradition of preservation and planning for the future, the Senate has passed S. 1995. When it becomes law, we will be able to house historical air and spacecraft, underscoring the major advances we have developed and the contributions to history we have made. Construction efforts for the Air and Space extension at Dulles, estimated to cost $200 million, represents exemplary coordination between public funds from the Commonwealth of Virginia and private sources. It is expected that the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum Dulles Center could be completed by 2003, in time for the 100 year anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first flight. This Dulles Center is an incredible, historical effort that will be a benefit to us now and for generations to come.
