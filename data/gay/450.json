This is a timely issue, considering our passage yesterday of H.R. 1913, which expands hate crimes protection to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered Americans, among others. It is appalling that a particular group of loyal, patriotic Americans is targeted for attack and ridicule because of the peaceful observance of their faith.', u'Sikh communities continue to live in fear of hate crimes. Since September 11, 2001, the Justice Department has investigated over 800 incidents of biased attacks against Sikh, Arab, Muslim, and South Asian Americans. More than 40 of these investigations resulted in criminal conviction. Tragically, however, the true extent of hate crimes against Sikh Americans and others may be grossly underreported. Because of the politically sensitive nature of these attacks and the intimidation in many communities, persecuted minorities often do not bring this abuse to the attention of law enforcement. If hate crimes against Sikh Americans and other post-9/11 communities do not come to light, there is a danger that the gravity of the problem will escape the attention of lawmakers and law enforcement officials and continue to leave our communities vulnerable to bias attacks in the future. We cannot let this slip through the cracks!', u'In the days after the attacks of September 11, 2001, there was an enormous backlash against the Arab and Muslim American communities. The Sikh community was often confused for Arabs or Muslims. Identified by their conspicuous items of faith, Sikhs became easy targets for anyone wishing to take out their rage. Hundreds of incidents of intimidation and violence brought national attention to the problem. As time has passed, however, few people take note of the isolated, but still insidious hate crimes that affect Sikh Americans every year.', u"Just this year, in Queens, New York, a 21 year-old Sikh man was viciously attacked by hooligans who pelted him with racial epithets as they pulled on his beard and hair. He survived, but not before they had stabbed him in the eye, depriving him not only of his sight, but of his dignity. His story is too common. Last year, in New Jersey, a Sikh boy's turban was set on fire and scalp and hair burned while he was participating in school activity. His attacker was expelled, but charged simply with mischief. The list goes on and on. From Sikh Americans beaten and bloodied as they go out for a jog to cab drivers being murdered in cold blood, each act of violence chips away at the freedom of every American. ", u'If we do not stand up for one another, who will? I stand up today for Sikh Americans and, indeed, all those who are singled out for who they are or what they believe. While these attacks were based on the mistaken belief that Sikhs are Muslims or Arabs, attacks on any such group are un-American and threaten the freedom we all work to protect. I urge my colleagues to keep a careful eye on attacks such as these. We must not ignore the problem. We must confront it, call it what it is, and work to make sure these kinds of attacks never happen again. When they do, we must make these bigots famous, and punish them to the fullest extent of the law.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2009/05/15/E1179-4_hate-crimes-against-sikh-americans/'}
