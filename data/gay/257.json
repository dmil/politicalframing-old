On October 10, 2005, Ms. Leonard will celebrate 30 years of service to the citizens of Nassau County and Long Island.", "Long Island Crisis Center was created in the 1970s by students of Adelphi University to promote counseling for students by students via telephone or face-to-face appointments. Since then, the Center has expanded to help countless Long Islanders with a wide array of programs.", "Ms. Leonard has been in charge of the Center since 1979. She has brought support to numerous groups on Long Island and has brought the LICC from its very humble beginnings to an established multi-service agency. The people of Long Island are in debt to the work of this committed woman.", "There have been many groundbreaking programs established by Ms. Leonard in her 30 years of service. For example, in the late 1970s runaway and homeless youth had no where to turn to for support. Ms. Leonard changed that in conjunction with the Nassau County Youth Board. She established the Runaway and Homeless Youth Hotline along with housing for these young people. She further led the way in the creation of Nassau Haven, a shelter for these same youth. While this shelter was not opened until 1980, the LICC continued to help these young members of the Long Island community.", "Ms. Leonard is also responsible in creating support lines for people from stigmatized populations of Long Island. She had led the fight to create peer counseling and assistance programs for gay and lesbian youth. She pursued this fight through the 1980s, a time where this policy was viewed as highly unpopular. In 1993, LICC formed Pride for Youth with a grant from the Paul Rapoport Foundation. Pride for Youth's mission is to enhance the health and wellness of these youth through education, supportive services, and youth development.", "It is the strong leadership of this woman that has allowed the LICC to be an effective organization in helping those members of the Long Island community most needing help. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me in congratulating Linda in her 30 years of service. Best wishes, Linda, and I can only hope you continue serving Long Island in the exceptional way you have for 30 years."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/10/06/E2021_in-recognition-of-ms-linda-leonard/"}
