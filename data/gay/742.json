Powerful business interests and Hollywood moguls like Steven Spielberg have severed their links with the scouts, and the taxpayer-funded public broadcasting system have attacked them as well. However, an overwhelming majority of the United Way chapters and the American people themselves have not cowered and have stood tall against this disgraceful campaign of intimidation.', u'In my own constituency, for instance, the Orange County United Way Chapter has given local scout troops and organizations $1.3 million over the last 3 years and has no sign of letting up. Just recently, the City of Huntington Beach, for example, has named itself the Tree City USA for its greenery. Many of those trees in Huntington Beach were planted by local boy scout troops doing their good deeds and community service.', u'The United Way chapters that did cave into the pressure were mostly from liberal university towns where ordinary decency is often treated with scorn and derision, but in the American heartland, in communities where families jealously guard virtues like loyalty and bravery and reverence, the support for the Boy Scouts has remained steadfast, and I would encourage every American to inquire as to what their local United Way is doing in this controversy.', u'One of the supreme ironies with this campaign against the scouts is that local Americans, ordinary Americans have stepped up and stepped into the breach to support the scouts when the United Way has pulled its support. This overwhelming backing for the scouts has exposed the opposition for what it is, marginal and well financed and vocal but a vitriolic minority nonetheless.', u"Mainstream America obviously believes that the Boy Scouts have the right to set their own moral standards and to include God in the scout oath. By the way, the Girl Scouts of America, which have many wonderful programs and are celebrating an anniversary this year, gave in to political correctness when it came to God and their scout oath. It is no longer required for Girl Scouts to acknowledge God in the scout oath. This is especially sad when young girls need a spiritual foundation to cope with the challenges and the temptations faced by today's young people.", u'The argument of those attacking the scouts has been that the scouts are being discriminatory. Well, yes, but they have a right to base their organization on certain beliefs like in God or in certain standards of behavior, sexual or otherwise. It is called freedom of association, and to those who call this discrimination, I ask, is this not what gay groups and even AIDS organizations do, discriminate? Some ask what do I mean?', u"Well, does anyone doubt that Christian fundamentalists are being excluded from these organizations, from homosexual and AIDS organizations because these religious fundamentalists might want to preach at these people? Is this not a discrimination against those people's religion? Well, of course, it is a discrimination against their religion, but those groups, just like the scouts, have a right to have associations based on shared values.", u'When gays were targeted by police for personal abuse and victimized by hatemongers, their rights were obviously being violated, and good people stood up. They united to end this injustice.', u'Today, it is the right of people with more traditional values, like the scouts, who are being under attack simply for trying to live their own lives with their own moral standards. The scouts in Orange County, for example, have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees in order to protect their right to have God in the scout oath. This is intolerable and the scouts are not the only ones facing this stupid political correctness.', u'Recently the Red Cross in Orange County canceled an appearance of a local school chorus before one of their meetings because the songs that were planned to be sung at that meeting mentioned God, like America the Beautiful. Well, later on the Red Cross apologized but only after a hailstorm of criticism.', u'What is going on here? Americans have a right not to be forced to participate in what they do not believe, but do not people with religious persuasions have a right to have their own standards? Wake up, America. It can get worse and it will get worse unless we stand tall and we stand together against this kind of nonsense.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/03/20/H1076-6_commending-local-united-way-chapters-for-continuin/'}
