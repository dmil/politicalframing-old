Rev. Pott died on September 1, 2002, after a two-year battle with bone marrow cancer.', u'Rev. Pott was a leader in fighting for the inclusion of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in the leadership of the Presbyterian Church. During his eleven years at the First Presbyterian Church in San Rafael, from 1986-1997, he promoted inclusion and acceptance of diversity within the church. While at the Church in San Rafael, Rev. Pott ran for moderator, the top job in the Presbyterian Church USA. Although he lost the election, he ran on a platform calling for ordination of lesbians and gays that brought the issue national attention.', u"Before coming to San Rafael, Rev. Pott was a minister at the First Presbyterian Church in Berkeley where he worked for the rights of migrant farm workers, supported the work of Martin Luther King Jr. and counseled students at the University of California Berkeley during the Free Speech Movement on campus. After leaving Berkeley, Rev. Pott worked in Davis with Cesar Chavez for the rights of farm workers and was also a vocal leader for women's rights.", u"Norman Pott was born in Summit, New Jersey. He attended Wheaton College in Illinois where he married his wife, Enid, on graduation day in 1954. He was drafted to the National Basketball Association from Wheaton, but rejected the offer in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a minister. He received a master's degree in divinity in 1957 from Princeton Theological Seminary and a doctorate in philosophy in 1960 at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.", u'Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Norman Pott for his many contributions to the community and the Church. His vision for the Presbyterian Church will continue to inspire both the Church and the communities in which he served.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/10/08/E1794-2_tribute-to-the-reverend-norman-pott/'}
