I again thank Senators Campbell, Schumer, Clinton, Biden and Feingold for cosponsoring our bipartisan measure. I commend Representatives Manzullo and Nadler for their bipartisan leadership on the House companion bill, H.R. 3297, and I thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers for their strong support as well.', u"Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with the New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. Father Judge, who was gay, was survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible to receive payments through the PSOB Program. This is simply wrong and must be remedied.", u'Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers who were killed on September 11, but who are ineligible for Federal death benefits because they died without a surviving spouse, child, or parent. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine other fallen heroes receive their public safety officer benefits.', u"In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as members of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would make these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit available to public safety officers who have been permanently disabled as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the survivors of officers who have died.", u'Finally, I applaud the National Association of Police Organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for their strong support for this bill to honor public safety officers and their families.', u"This legislation provides much-needed relief for the survivors of the brave public servants who selflessly risk and sacrifice their own lives everyday so that others might live. I look forward to President Bush signing the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002 into law."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2002/06/12/S5442_morning-business/'}
