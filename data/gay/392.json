They are concerned about many issues that reflect our culture in ways that are not healthy.", "E.J. Dionne, Jr., one of the most thoughtful journalistic observers of our scene, recently had a column in the Washington Post titled, ``Split Over Morality,'' which I ask to be printed in the Record after my remarks.", "For those of you who saw it originally in the Post, it is worth rereading, and for those who did not, it should be read and clipped and saved.", "The column follows:", "It is remarkable how quickly political talk these days turns to the question: What does the religious right want? Variations on the theme include: How much must Bob Dole do to get the votes of Christian conservatives? Can't President Clinton help himself by hanging the religious right around Dole's neck? All this might be taken as a great victory by Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition he directs. The obituary of the religious right has been written over and over since the rise of the Moral Majority in 1980. Yet none of this has stopped the Christian conservative movement from expanding its influence. Reed and his troops have already gotten a lot of credit for help Dole stop Pat Buchanan's surge dead in the South Carolina primary. That is the very definition of political power. Reed and his followers have every right to do what they are doing. Religious people have the same rights as union members, environmentalists, business groups and feminists. President Clinton himself has spoken at hundreds of black churches. The president is often at his most effective from the pulpit, an exceptionally good venue for his favorite speeches about the links between personal responsibility and social justice, crime and unemployment. Democrats thus have no grounds for challenging Reed's argument that his people deserve ``a place at the table'' of national politics. What does need real debate is more important. It has to do with how moral issues should be discussed in politics, and also how they should be defined. A lot of Americans--including many who want nothing to do with Ralph Reed--have a vague but strong sense that what's going wrong in American life is not just about economics. It also entails an ethical or moral crisis. Evidence for this is adduced from family breakdown, teen pregnancy, high crime rates (especially among teenagers), and trashy movies, television and music. But unlike many on the Christian Right, these same Americans see strong links between moral and economic issues. Their sense that commitments are not being honored includes family commitments, but it also includes the obligations between employer and employee and the question of whether those ``who work hard and play by the rules,'' as the president likes to put it, are getting just treatment. Democrats, liberals and other assorted critics of the religious right have no problem in discussing these economic matters. But they have made the reverse mistake of Reed and his friends: The religious right's foes have only rarely (and only relatively recently) been willing to understand that many American families see the moral crisis whole. It's possible, and reasonable, to be worried about both trashy entertainment and the rewards that go to the hard-working. Human beings are both economic and moral creatures. But liberals often cringe when the word ``morality'' is even mentioned. Giving the Christian right a near monopoly on moral discussion has narrowed the moral debate. This narrowing needs to be challenged. To hear leaders of the religious right talk in recent weeks, for example, one of the preeminent moral issues of our time is whether gay marriages should be sanctioned by state or local governments. But surely this is not even the 10th or the 25th most important issue for most Americans. The resolution of this question one way or the other will do virtually nothing about the moral issues such as crime or family breakup that actually do trouble lots of people. It's easy enough to recognize why tradition-minded Americans are uneasy with this broadening of the definition of ``marriage.'' But turning this question into yet another political litmus test will only push the political debate toward yet another ugly round of gay-bashing. Is that what 1996 should be about? What needs to be fought is a tendency described movingly by Stephen Carter in his new book, ``Integrity.'' It is a tendency Carter quite fairly discerns all across the political discussion. ``I must confess that the great political movements of our day frighten me with their reckless certainties and their insistence on treating people as means to be manipulated rather than as the ends for which government exists,'' he writes. ``Too many partisans seems to hate their opponents, who are demonized in terms so creative that I weep at the waste of energy, and, as one who struggles to be a Christian, I find the hatred painful.'' So would we all. "], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1996/04/17/S3498-2_split-over-morality/"}
