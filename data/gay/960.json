Ann Richards lost her battle to esophageal cancer, at the age of 73, on September 13, 2006 at her home in Austin, Texas--she was only diagnosed with cancer in March of this year. Following her diagnosis she underwent chemotherapy treatments and was poised to fight her illness with vigor and tenacity just as she fought her personal demons and political opponents.", "Ann Richards had a zest for life that was evident and infectious. She made those of us fortunate enough to have known her, smile just at the mention of her name. She was a wonderful public speaker and found ways to intimately connect with real people by tackling difficult issues that affected their everyday lives such as the relegation of women to the home and the exclusion of minorities in the political process.", "Ann was tremendously tenacious but possessed a quick wit. She was well known for her zingy one liners and warm sense of humor. She once said, ``I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh,'' and throughout her lifetime she kept the jokes coming.", "Born in Lakeview (now Lacy Lakeview) Texas in 1933, Ann was first introduced to politics after joining the debate team and participating in Girls State--a program where high school students are invited to the capitol to participate in a mock government. However, before entering politics in 1976, she earned her teaching certificate and taught social studies and history at Fulmore Junior High School. This was her life's passion. She once said that teaching was the hardest work she ever did and her commitment to educating youth did not dissipate with age.", "Committed to issues of equity and inclusion, Ann spent much of her life championing causes related to the marginalization of women and minorities in particular. She dedicated herself to increasing the role of women in politics. Ann organized training sessions throughout Texas designed to empower women in politics and succeeded in improving the visibility of women in the National Democratic Party. Leading by example, she embarked upon her own political career in 1976 when she ran against and unseated a three term incumbent to become Travis County Commissioner. She would serve in this capacity for four years before being elected State Treasurer in 1982, becoming the first woman to hold an office at the State level since Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson in the 1920s. Ann became the Governor of Texas in 1991 and continued to champion the inclusion of all people in the political process.", "While in office, Ann oversaw a program of economic revitalization that grew the state's economy. As governor, Ann appointed Zan W. Holmes Jr., the first African American appointed to the University of Texas Board of Regents; she redirected revenue from the state lottery to a school fund to support public education; and launched the Robin Hood plan, an attempt to equalize funding across school districts. Through these measures, Ann was successful in changing the ways that both Texas and our country thought about and treated women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and members of the Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Bisexual communities. Ann once remarked that she entered politics to help those who were often ignored by the Texas' male dominated establishment.", "After losing the gubernatorial race to George W. Bush in 1995, Ann served in various capacities. She worked as a political strategist and labored on many democratic campaigns, often campaigning on behalf of candidates like Howard Dean. She continued to teach, introducing courses such as Women and Leadership at the University of Texas; worked diligently to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, which will open its doors next year; and lived as an example for all those battling substance abuse. These are but a few pieces of Ann's selfless contributions and they will never be forgotten.", "We all mourn the loss of Dorothy Ann Willis Richards. Her words and her deeds, much like her striking silver hair, will long be remembered. Although she was a wonderful cook, she held that title contrary to the prevailing image of the quintessential woman, at the time, she did not want to be known for having kept a clean home rather she wanted to be remembered for having helped others.", "My friend, your wish has been granted. Through your words and deeds you have left an indelible mark on both the great state of Texas and on our Nation.", "Austin, Texas (AP)--Former Gov. Ann Richards, the witty and flamboyant Democrat who went from homemaker to national political celebrity, died Wednesday night after a battle with cancer, a family spokeswoman said. She was 73. She died at home surrounded by her family, the spokeswoman said. Richards was found to have esophageal cancer in March and underwent chemotherapy treatments. The silver-haired, silver-tongued Richards said she entered politics to help others--especially women and minorities who were often ignored by Texas' male-dominated establishment. ``I did not want my tombstone to read, `She kept a really clean house.' I think I'd like them to remember me by saying, `She opened government to everyone,' '' Richards said shortly before leaving office in January 1995. Whether or not she succeeded at that, there was no question she cracked open the door. Her single term as governor had ended in a 1994 defeat to George W. Bush, who went from besting his father's silver- haired critic to the governor's office to the presidency. ``Texas has lost one of its great daughters,'' President Bush said in a statement after learning of Richards' death. Two years before she was elected governor of Texas, Ann Richards electrified the 1988 Democratic National Convention with a keynote speech in which she joked that the Republican presidential nominee, George H.W. Bush, had been ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' A longtime champion of women and minorities in government who was serving at the time as Texas state treasurer, she won cheers when she reminded delegates that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, ``only backwards and in high heels.'' As governor, Richards appointed the first black University of Texas regent, the first crime victim on the state Criminal Justice Board, the first disabled person on the human services board and the first teacher to lead the State Board of Education. Under Richards, the fabled Texas Rangers pinned stars on their first black and female officers. Ron Kirk, the black former mayor of Dallas, said Richards helped him get his first political internship during a state constitutional convention in 1974 and later, as governor, made him secretary of state. ``She set the table so somebody like me could become mayor of Dallas,'' Kirk said. She also polished Texas' image, courted movie producers, campaigned for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, oversaw a doubling of the state prison system and presided over rising student achievement scores and plunging dropout rates. Throughout her years in office, her popularity remained high. One poll put it at over 60 percent the year she lost her re-election bid to Bush. Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry described Richards as ``the epitome of Texas politics: a figure larger than life who had a gift for captivating the public with her great wit.'' ``Ann loved Texas, and Texans loved her,'' President Bush said. ``As a public servant, she earned respect and admiration. Ann became a national role model, and her charm, wit and candor brought a refreshing vitality to public life.'' U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Richards never lost her zest for life. ``I wrote her a note when I heard about her cancer and she wrote me back a wonderful letter. She was upbeat and positive and I think she was going to go out with guns blazing,'' Hutchison said Wednesday night. Richards was diagnosed with cancer in March and underwent chemotherapy treatments. Her four adult children spent the day with her before she died Wednesday night at her home in Austin, said Cathy Bonner, a longtime family friend and family spokeswoman. Born in Lakeview, Texas, in 1933, Richards grew up near Waco, married civil rights lawyer David Richards and spent her early adulthood volunteering in campaigns and raising four children. She often said the hardest job she ever had was as a public school teacher at Fulmore Junior High School in Austin. In the early 1960s, she helped form the North Dallas Democratic Women, ``basically to allow us to have something substantive to do; the regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts.'' Richards served on the Travis County Commissioners Court in Austin for six years before jumping to a bigger arena in 1982 when her election as state treasurer made her the first woman elected statewide in nearly 50 years. But politics took a toll. It cost her a marriage and forced her in 1980 to seek treatment for alcoholism. ``I had seen the very bottom of life,'' she once recalled. ``I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.'' After her re-election defeat, Richards went on to give speeches, work as a commentator for Cable News Network and serve as a senior adviser in the New York office of Public Strategies. In her last 10 years, Richards worked for many social causes and helped develop the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, scheduled to open in Austin in 2007. Richards said she never missed being in public office. She grinned when asked what she might have done differently had she known she would be a one-term governor. ``Oh,'' she said, ``I would probably have raised more hell.''"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/09/28/E1882-3_in-tribute-to-dorothy-ann-willis-richards-civic-le/"}
