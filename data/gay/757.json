The Senate's consideration of this important measure was long overdue and its passage is one of the major civil rights victories of this century.", u'We are all aware of the tragic deaths of James Byrd in Texas and Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. James Byrd was murdered because of the color of his skin. Matthew Shepard was murdered because of his sexual orientation.', u'In the Byrd killing, the federal government could help.', u'In the Shepard killing, the federal government could not help local law enforcement. Why? Because our current hate crimes statute is full of holes and desperately needs to be updated.', u"Right now the federal hate crimes law does not cover disability, gender or sexual orientation. In addition, the federal government can prosecute only those crimes where the victim was chosen because he or she was engaged in a ``federally protected activity,'' such as attending public school or serving as a juror. That is a very narrow basis on which to bring a lawsuit.", u"Because Matthew Shepard was killed because he was gay, the federal government could not provide the resources Laramie, Wyoming's law enforcement so desperately needed. This is why our federal hate crimes law ought to apply whenever a hate crime occurs.", u"Last year Dennis and Judy Shepard, Matthew's parents, came to Capitol Hill to plead with us to broaden the hate crimes law. I suspect that no Senator who met them will ever forget their words or the anguish in their eyes. It was an anguish that probably only a parent who has lost a child can possibly understand.", u'During their visit to Capitol Hill, and all across America, the Shepards have found the strength to talk about their own tragic experience to help prevent other parents from experiencing their nightmare. Had we not passed the Kennedy-Smith Amendment we would have been ignoring their pleas, and the pleas of so many others.', u'The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will end, once and for all, the contortions that federal prosecutors must undertake to exercise jurisdiction over hate crimes. The Hatch Amendment will not.', u'The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will allow federal authorities to assist in state and local prosecutions of hate crimes on the basis of disability, gender and sexual orientation. The Hatch Amendment will not.', u"We don't need to collect more data on hate crimes. We don't need to analyze the problem. We need to solve it.", u'We already collect information on hate crimes and the statistics are grim. In the last year for which we have statistics, 1998, almost 8,000 hate crime incidents were reported.', u"And we already know that state and local law enforcement needs our help because they have told us so. The National Sheriff's Association has told us so. The International Association of Police Chiefs has told us so. Both the Sheriff and Police Commander of Laramie, Wyoming have urged us to pass the Kennedy-Smith Amendment. The Laramie Sheriff and Police Commander came with Dennis and Judy Shepard to Capitol Hill. They told us what it meant for their departments to be without the assistance of the federal government in investigating and prosecuting Matthew Shepard's murder. It meant that they had to lay off 5 law enforcement officials as a result of the financial strain of the prosecution of Matthew Shepard's killers.", u'If the Kennedy-Smith Amendment had been law, those officers would not have been laid off.', u'We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will bring about substantial change. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will provide law enforcement, in places like Laramie, Wyoming, the tools they need to investigate and prosecute hate crimes wherever they occur. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will send a strong message that the federal government will prosecute every hate crime with vigor.', u'I am proud that this Senate has now stood with Dennis and Judy Shepard. I am proud this Senate did not let the politics of misunderstanding keep us from enacting a bill that would enable prosecutions of crimes motivated by hatred of gays and lesbians--the motivation for some of the most vicious hate crimes.', u"There are those who argued that this amendment was not needed because it only affects a small percentage of Americans. I am troubled by this suggestion. Hate crimes diminish us all. Did this Congress say, in 1965, that we didn't need a Civil Rights Act because racial discrimination ``only'' affected a small percentage of Americans? No. We are talking about basic protections that all Americans should be afforded. If they are denied to any of us, we are all affected.", u'We must make sure that the federal government leaves no American unprotected. The Kennedy-Smith Amendment is a bipartisan, reasonable, measured response to a serious problem. Now we must ensure that it becomes law.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2000/06/22/S5649_hate-crimes/'}
