That demonstrates the profoundly conservative approach the American people and their representatives in Congress have taken to changing the Constitution. Polls show that that approach continues today. Even among those who oppose gay marriage, a majority oppose using a constitutional amendment to ban it.", "For my part, I believe that a committed couple, regardless of gender, should have the right to participate in a state-recognized marriage or civil union and to enjoy the rights and responsibilities conveyed by that legal relationship. It is in our society's interest that committed couples, whether in ``traditional'' or same-sex unions, be not only allowed but encouraged to form households, have families, and contribute to the health and stability of their neighborhoods and communities.", "What religious bodies choose to recognize, sanction, or bless as marriage should be entirely up to them.", "There are much more important issues we could be spending this time on. The American people have much higher priorities than this--the misguided effort to bring democracy to Iraq; the faltering economy; the loss of good jobs; the half-hearted, underfunded war on terrorism; the high price of gas; the millions of Americans without health insurance; and so on.", "Mr. Speaker, this waste of an afternoon in an effort to pollute our Constitution with language requiring discrimination against a particular group of people, in violation of basic principles of federalism, is just wrong, and I urge my colleagues to show they share my disdain for this charade by voting ``no.''"], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/2004/09/30/H7898-2_marriage-protection-amendment/"}
