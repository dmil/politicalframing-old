She was a wonderful public speaker and found ways to intimately connect with real people by tackling difficult issues that affected their everyday lives. Ann was tremendously tenacious but possessed a quick wit. She was well known for her zingy-one-liners and warm sense of humor.', u'Committed to issues of equity and inclusion, Ann spent much of her life championing causes related to the marginalization of women and minorities in particular. She dedicated herself to increasing the role of women in politics. Ann organized training sessions throughout Texas designed to empower women in politics and succeeded in improving the visibility of women in the National Democratic Party. Aim became the Governor of Texas in 1991 and continued to champion the inclusion of all people in the political process.', u"While in office, Ann oversaw a program of economic revitalization that grew the state's economy. As governor, Ann appointed Zan W. Holmes Jr., the first African-American appointed to the University of Texas Board of Regents; she redirected revenue from the state lottery to a school fund to support public education; and launched the Robin Hood plan, an attempt to equalize funding across school districts. Through these measures, Ann was successful in changing the ways that both Texas and our country thought about and treated women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and members of the Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Bisexual communities. Ann once remarked that she entered politics to help those who were often ignored by the Texas' male dominated establishment.", u'It is with great pride that I rise in support of H.R. 42 and recognize, before all, the contributions of a wonderful woman, committed leader and champion for all.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2007/03/06/E467-3_recognizing-ann-richards-extraordinary-contributio/'}
