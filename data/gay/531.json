This very narrow legislative change would allow chronically ill New York residents to take control of their own lives by guaranteeing them access to a variety of health care options in New York State at lower prices.", "A combination of Federal and state laws have unintentionally ``locked in'' about 400 Medicare-eligible, disabled New Yorkers into an expensive, fee-for-service health plan. They cannot leave the plan because they require needed medical coverage and, because of Federal laws, they actually are prohibited from changing plans. They literally are trapped in a health plan and my legislation allows them to leave the expensive policy and give them the quality health care they want at the prices they can afford.", "This legislation is predicted not to cost anything and actually could save Federal dollars. By allowing disabled citizens to purchase private insurance with their own money, this legislation ensures that these citizens will have access to the benefits that will keep them healthier longer. The longer these individuals stay healthy, the longer they will be able to avoid using hospitalization covered by Medicare. This will save the taxpayer money. Also, by allowing them to purchase less expensive insurance, they will not be forced to ``spend down'' their resources in order to qualify for Medicaid.", "If this proposal becomes law, these New Yorkers will be free to choose from more than 30 state-mandated managed care or point of service plans. Wherever they choose to go, they will be guaranteed identical benefits to the ones they currently have at much cheaper costs.", "This initiative is strongly supported in New York by the New York State Department of Insurance, the Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition (1 in 9), the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, Gay Men's Health Crisis, Medicare Rights Center, and New Yorkers for Accessible Health Coverage, among many others. These are the consumer groups that represent the individuals locked into the fee-for-service plan and each fully supports giving consumers options and lowering their health care costs.", "Americans should be able to choose their health care. We should give them the tools they need to stay independent for as long as possible and give them access to affordable, quality health care. This will allow them to have more money to buy other important things and keep them in control of their lives and their future. They will worry less about whether they can afford their health insurance premiums and give them the financial security to take care of their families. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation because it will provide health care security to these individuals who need it the most."], "capitolwords_url": "http://capitolwords.org/date/1998/10/06/E1925-2_medicare-anti-duplication-amendment/"}
