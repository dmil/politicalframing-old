Attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Coretta Scott King earned a Bachelor's Degree in music and education, skills she used to organize Freedom Concerts to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Serving as a delegate from Women Strike for Peace at a 1962 Disarmament Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, Mrs. King demonstrated her commitment to working for peace and justice worldwide.", u"Following the tragic murder of her husband, Coretta Scott King committed herself to promoting Dr. King's principles of nonviolence and social justice. First, in establishing the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, which has trained tens of thousands of people in the philosophy and methods of Dr. King, she has been able to preserve and further his legacy. Second, she served as chair of the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission and worked for the national recognition of Dr. King's birthday.", u"In addition to working for the recognition of her husband's legacy, Mrs. King was always a tireless advocate for the abolition of Apartheid in South Africa, women and children's rights, gay and lesbian dignity, full employment and ecological sanity. In recognition of this work, Coretta Scott King has lead goodwill missions across the globe consulting with world leaders. In addition, the American Library Association has awarded Coretta Scott King Awards to more than 175 books written or illustrated by African Americans that promote understanding and appreciation for all cultures and demonstrate commitment to equality and justice.", u'Surely the passing of Coretta Scott King is a great loss to this Nation and the world. Mrs. King demonstrated a resilience and commitment to the ideals of equality and justice that has been matched by few and we all owe her a debt of gratitude.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/02/08/E102-4_honoring-the-life-and-accomplishments-of-coretta-s/'}
