While I and constituents throughout my district, including those in Richmond, California, mourn her loss we remember her achievements, her courage, and what she symbolized to people across the country and throughout the world.", u"While she was Dr. King's partner in the struggle for equal rights, Coretta Scott King was also a civil rights activist in her own right. Dr. King once said, ``I wish I could say . . . that I led her down this path. But I must say we went down it together, because she was as actively involved and concerned when we met as she is now.''", u'An inspirational woman to so many already, Mrs. King will remain a role model for generations to come.', u"When her husband's fight for equality was cut short by the brutal shot of bigotry and hatred, Mrs. King's fight had only just begun. And now with her death, we face the same question she faced so many years ago. President Clinton eloquently spoke about this question yesterday at Mrs. King's funeral service in Atlanta when he said,", u". . . the most important day in her life for everyone of us here at this moment in this church, except when she embraced her faith, the next most important day was April 5, 1968, the day after her husband was killed. She had to decide, ``What am I going to do with the rest of my life?'' We would have all forgiven her, even honored her if she said, ``I have stumbled on enough stony roads. I have been beaten by enough bitter rods. I have endured enough dangers, toils and snares. I'm going home and raising my kids. I wish you all well.'' None of us, nobody could have condemned that decision. But instead, she went to Memphis--the scene of the worst nightmare of her life--and led that march for those poor hard-working garbage workers that her husband [advocated for]. Now, that's the most important thing for us. Because what really matters if you believe all this stuff we've been saying is, ``What are we going to do with the rest of our lives?''", u"Indeed, she went on to work so hard for all of us. In addition to her efforts to build the Martin Luther King memorial in Atlanta to establishing a national holiday in her husband's memory, Coretta Scott King worked tirelessly so that her husband's struggle, and the struggle of the millions of Americans who worked with him and shared his vision to bring equality to all people, was never forgotten.", u"She took upon herself the responsibility of keeping alive Dr. King's civil rights legacy but also found her own causes. She advocated equality for all. She became active with the National Organization for Women and said, ``Women, if the soul of the Nation is to be saved, I believe that you must become its soul.'' In 2000 she spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Metropolitan Community Church, a predominantly gay denomination in San Francisco, where she gave a powerful speech expressing that ``until everybody has equality; no one has equality. We can't just be for civil rights of one group.''", u'The King family has a strong history with the community in Richmond, ', u"Mrs. King's speech in San Francisco inspired Jerrold Hatchett of Richmond to form the National Brotherhood Alliance, a non-profit organization that serves as a collaborative of business, community, religious, and grassroots organizations to mentor youth and address community issues.", u'Richmond Mayor Irma Anderson remembers attending Union Methodist Church in Boston with the Kings. Her husband, Rev. Booker T. Anderson, who went on to become a Richmond city councilman, attended Boston University School of Theology with Dr. King. Their relationship was one of the reasons Dr. King stopped in Richmond to meet with local leaders when he visited northern California in 1961. Mayor Anderson remembers Mrs. King as being loyal to her husband and family and supportive of the civil rights movement, and she had a beautiful singing voice.', u"Mayor Anderson said that, ``Mrs. King's singing voice changed after her husband was murdered.'' It, however, did not alter her passion for justice and she continued her struggles against injustice.", u'Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my constituents, I rise to acknowledge the loss of a great woman, a mother, a friend to all and a hero. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the King family and their friends in this difficult time.', u"America owes the entire King family an enormous debt of gratitude for teaching all Americans the meaning of dignity, patriotism and justice. This Congress, and this nation, must not let down Dr. King down. We must not let Mrs. King down. We must pursue their vision of justice and freedom as vigilantly today as ever before and preserve the greatness of America for our children and our children's children."], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2006/02/08/E105-2_honoring-the-life-and-accomplishments-of-mrs-coret/'}
