He was 94. I knew Ted first as a friend of my late father, but the academic world knew Dr. Sarbin as a pioneering research psychologist who helped shape the modern science of psychology.', u'Born Theodore Ray Sarbin on May 8, 1911, Ted rose from humble beginnings in Cleveland, Ohio, as one of six children of Russian immigrant parents. As a young man, he rode the rails as a hobo, an experience he later said helped him identify with people on the margins of society. In 1941, he earned a Ph.D. from Ohio State University and did further post doctorate work at the University of Chicago. His dissertation used data gathered at the University of Minnesota to examine the relative accuracy of statistical versus clinical prediction of undergraduate success. During this time he also collaborated on research to measure hypnotic depth. This work pioneered research in these fields and framed the questions for hundreds of subsequent studies by psychologists.', u"In 1949, after a short stint as a clinical psychologist in Illinois and Los Angeles, he joined the faculty at UC Berkeley. In 1969, he left UC Berkeley to join the faculty at UC Santa Cruz. During these academic years, he gained the reputation as an energetic teacher and graduate student mentor, supervising more students than any other faculty member in his department. He also gained the reputation as a prolific author of studies and journal articles. He focused his work on psychopathology--the study of anti-social behavior and its root causes and effects. He became known as ``Mr. Role Theory,'' defending the unorthodox view that the label ``mental illness'' was often used as a moral judgment to express or exert social power over those whose conduct was perceived as unwanted or dangerous.", u'In the course of his academic career, Ted published over 250 scientific articles and book chapters. He received scores of honors, including both Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships. He received the Morton Prince Award from the Society for Clinical Experimental Hypnosis, as well as the Henry Murray Award from the American Psychological Association. In 2001, the Western Psychological Association recognized him with a lifetime achievement award. Although Ted officially retired in 1976, he never stopped working. He continued to teach and write throughout his life. Recently in Washington, D.C., Ted presented a new award named in his honor as part of the annual American Psychological Association convention.', u"Ted was perhaps best known for pioneering work he did on the subject of gays in the military. From 1987 until just before his death, Ted was a researcher for the Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. The Department of Defense founded the Center to study the impact of psychology on national security in the wake of its discovery of a spy ring embedded in the Navy. He had been at the Center less than a year when he co-authored a report which found no evidence to support the idea that gay and lesbian soldiers pose a security risk. The report later became public in 1990 when it was published under the title ``Gays in Uniform: The Pentagon's Secret Reports.''", u"The Report's publication propelled Ted into the spotlight. However, despite its notoriety, the ``Gays in Uniform'' report simply reflected the theme of Ted's life work: Listen to others and refrain from judgment in reporting the facts. Ted called this narrative psychology--listen to what the patient has to say rather than rush to characterize them.", u"Ted had a devoted following of former students and colleagues. He established a custom 40 years ago of hosting an annual party where he would present his own award ``Role Theorist of the Year,'' to one of those gathered. He presided over these celebrations with grace and wit. This past August, he hosted his final such banquet which drew over sixty participants.", u'Ted bought a vacation home in Carmel in the 1950s. He moved to my hometown for good in the 1970s. He loved to golf and played almost every Monday, always aiming to shoot his age, which he achieved at 89. He and his wife, Genevieve, often hosted elaborate costume parties where he always played the part of Don Quixote--a role he often played in his professional life.', u'Ted is survived by his sons Jim Allen, Ronald Allen, and Theodore Sarbin; sister Ruth Landy; domestic partner Karen Sobeck; four grandchildren: Mathew Allen, Chelsea Allen, Park Allen, and Link Allen; and two great grandchildren: MacKenzie Allen and Delaney Allen; and numerous people who still love and cherish him. His late wife Genevieve Sarbin, died in 1999.'], u'capitolwords_url': u'http://capitolwords.org/date/2005/10/07/E2081_in-honor-of-ted-sarbin/'}
